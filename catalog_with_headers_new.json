    "text": "Admission > Advanced Credit\n- Advanced Placement Credit Policy\n- College Entrance Exams\n\nAdvanced Credit\nHonors courses and other accelerated study in high school are excellent preparation for Vanderbilt. The well-\nestablished advanced-placement policy endeavors to recognize exceptional high school preparation, to avoid\nrequiring first-year students to take courses clearly mastered in high school, and to encourage students to begin\ntheir college learning experience at the level most appropriate to their preparation. Advanced placement may be\ngranted on the basis of good performance on the College Board Advanced Placement Examinations, on International\nBaccalaureate tests, or, in some cases, on placement tests given by Vanderbilt. Credit may also be awarded for the\nBritish G.C.E. “A” level examinations, the Advanced International Certificate of Education (AICE), the Cambridge Pre-\nU diploma, and similar tests, such as the French baccalauréat, the German abitur, or the Swiss maturité\nexaminations. To qualify for credit for the AICE examinations or individual A-level examinations, students must have\nachieved an A*, A, or B thereon. More information on international exam credit is available at\nregistrar.vanderbilt.edu/international-examinations.\nCollege Entrance Exams\nStudents may not take college entrance exams after they begin their enrollment at Vanderbilt University for the\npurpose of course placement or academic credit. This applies to SAT, ACT, Advanced Placement, International\nBaccalaureate, and any similar international exams.\nAdvanced Placement Credit Policy",

Grants, scholarships,\nand work opportunities are available to eligible students who apply for assistance and have demonstrated financial\nneed. Beginning in the fall of 2009, financial aid packages offered to incoming and current undergraduate students\nno longer included need-based loans. While continuing to meet the full demonstrated need of all eligible students,\nthis expanded aid initiative, Opportunity Vanderbilt, announced in October 2008 provides increased amounts of\nneed- based grants and/or scholarships (gift assistance) to replace need-based loans that would have otherwise\nbeen offered to meet a student’s demonstrated financial need.\nDemonstrated financial need is the difference between the cost of attending Vanderbilt and the amount that\nstudents and their families are expected to contribute toward that cost. The amount of aid to fully meet each\nstudent’s demonstrated financial need is determined annually on the basis of current financial information\nrequired/provided on relevant application forms.\nAdditional information is available at https://www.vanderbilt.edu/financialaid/undergraduate/index.php.\nUniversity General Medals, Prizes, and Awards\nAlso see the Honors chapters in the College of Arts and Science, Blair School of Music, School of Engineering, and\nPeabody College sections of this catalog for listings of additional awards and prizes.",

These “pre-major advisers” counsel students during their first three and one-half\nsemesters, or until the students choose majors, when they are assigned faculty advisers in their major department\nor program. Pre-major advisers are specially trained to help students move efficiently through the requirements of\nAXLE (Achieving eXcellence in Liberal Education) and chart a course of study.\nDuring the last two years of study, when a student is acquiring depth of knowledge in a major field, studies are\nguided by a specialist in that field. Students are encouraged to see their faculty advisers at any time, since the\nadvisers are available for guidance and counseling and are faculty members with whom advisees may be studying.\nAll students are required to see their advisers prior to registration for each semester.\nAdvisers are generally happy to talk over any problems students may have, although their chief function is",

Students are named to the Dean’s List\nwhen they earn a grade point average of at least 3.500 while carrying 12 or more graded credit hours, with no\ntemporary or missing grades in any course (credit or non-credit), and no grade of F. A student must be in a degree-\ngranting school.\nPhi Beta Kappa\nThe Alpha Chapter of Phi Beta Kappa in the state of Tennessee honors scholarly attainments in the liberal arts and\nsciences and annually elects seniors and juniors to membership during the spring semester.\nSeniors who have completed at least 60 credit hours in the College of Arts and Science and earned a cumulative\ngrade point average of 3.65 or higher are eligible for consideration, as are juniors who have completed at least 70\ncredit hours at Vanderbilt with a cumulative grade point average of at least 3.90. Juniors must have completed most\nAXLE requirements by the end of their junior year. For calculating credit hours and judging residence requirements,\nthe chapter treats foreign study programs in the same manner as does the College of Arts and Science.\nAttainment of the minimum required grade point average does not guarantee election. Membership in Phi Beta\nKappa is based on a demonstration of scholarly achievements, broad cultural interests, and high moral character.\nPage 121 of 1019",

As a guideline, for seniors at\nleast 90 credit hours must qualify as liberal. Grades earned in applied (vocational) or professional course work are\nnot counted in computing the grade point average. The breadth of a candidate’s program, as shown by the number\nand variety of courses taken outside the major, is also considered.\nPhi Beta Kappa has long emphasized the importance of mathematics and foreign language in a liberal education. In\nkeeping with this tradition, the chapter considers only those students who have demonstrated proficiency in these\nareas beyond the AXLE graduation requirements. Proficiency in reading, writing, and speaking a foreign language is\ntypically demonstrated by passing a course in a language at a level at least one semester beyond the AXLE\nrequirements. Courses must be taken on a graded rather than a P/F basis. The foreign language requirement may\nbe satisfied with College Board SAT Subject, Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, or Tennessee\nLanguage Center test scores.\nMathematics proficiency may be demonstrated by completing two semesters of calculus or one semester of calculus\nand one semester of statistics. Courses must be taken on a graded rather than a P/F basis. The mathematics\nrequirement may be satisfied with Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, or A-Level exam credit, but\nnot College Board SAT Subject test scores.",

All student recitals are open to the public. More than 350\nconcerts are presented at the school each year, and most are free of charge, as a gift to the community.\nA milestone in the Blair School's history was “The Blair Commissions: Music for the 21st Century,” a project funded\nby the James Stephen Turner Family Charitable Foundation, which has commissioned several important works by\nrenowned composers from 2005 through 2019. These include works by Susan Botti and Peter Schickele and four\nmajor works by Michael Hersch. Each composition received its premiere in Nashville, and all the works were then\neither recorded or performed in New York. The project has served two intertwined missions: to promote the\ncomposition of outstanding works by the world’s leading composers and to invite attention to the excellent\nensembles and faculty performers of Vanderbilt University.\nComposers-in-residence who have visited the Blair School include Robert Beaser, William Bolcom, Susan Botti,\nGeorge Crumb, Michael Daugherty, Lukas Foss, Gabriela Lena Frank, John Harbison, Michael Hersch, Karel Husa,\nSteven Mackey, Donald Martino, Cindy McTee, Jessie Montgomery, Kevin Puts, Christopher Rouse, Adam",

For example, some\nmajor programs require a full year of introductory chemistry; others do not. Students should become familiar with\nrequirements of those programs in which they have an interest and confer with their adviser at the time of\nenrollment and throughout the first year to plan a program of study that will keep options open as long as possible.\nSpecimen curricula for the engineering programs are given in the Courses of Study section. Requirements for the\nB.E. and B.S. degrees for the various programs vary in the minimum amount of hours and in specific course\nrequirements in the basic sciences and in mathematics.\nIncluded in the first year for all majors is the course Engineering Science 1401–1403 Introduction to Engineering,\nwhich introduces the student to design tools used in all areas of engineering.\nMathematics and Physics\nEntering engineering students will be placed in the appropriate level mathematics course.

Biomedical engineering builds on these foundations to solve\nproblems in biology and medicine over the widest range of scales-from the nanoscale and molecular levels to the\nwhole body. Biomedical engineering provides a robust platform for employment in the medical device and\ninstrumentation industries as well as careers in companies that specialize in the development and application of\nbiologics, biomaterials, computation, implants and processes. Our graduates gain entry into nationally recognized\ngraduate schools for continuing studies in biomedical engineering.\nBiomedical engineering is also a rigorous path for admission to and success in medical school for those students\nPage 185 of 1019",

The minor is administered by the School of Engineering.\nNanoscience and nanotechnology are based on the ability to synthesize, organize, characterize, and manipulate\nmatter systematically at dimensions of ~1 to 100 nm, creating uniquely functional materials that differ in properties\nfrom those prepared by traditional approaches. At these length scales, materials can take on new properties that\ncan be exploited in a wide range of applications such as for solar energy conversion, ultra-sensitive sensing, and\nnew types of vaccines. These activities require the integration of expertise from various areas of science and\nengineering, often relying on methods of synthesis, fabrication, and characterization that are beyond those\nencountered in an individual course of study.\nStudents who minor in nanoscience and nanotechnology learn the principles and methods used in this rapidly\ngrowing field.

The 36-hour interdisciplinary major in child studies\ndraws on courses from psychology, education, special education, and human and organizational development. The\nmajor is excellent pre-professional preparation for students interested in graduate school in psychology or\neducation, in law (e.g., child and family advocacy), or in various health related areas (e.g., medicine, nursing)\ninvolving children. It is also appropriate for students who are interested in gaining a broader understanding of\nchildren and families in contemporary society. The major areas covered are: developmental psychology; learning;\nresearch methods; language and literacy; and families, community, and diversity.\nHonors Program\nThe Honors Program in child studies offers qualified majors the opportunity to conduct individual research projects\nin collaboration with faculty members. This research experience culminates in the writing and public presentation of\na senior thesis.

Cultural anthropology examines the relationships, beliefs, values, and political-economic\npractices that shape individual behavior, community life, and power in modern societies. Archaeology studies\nsocieties through their material remains, enabling long-term perspectives on the human past as well as connections\nto present-day descendant communities. Linguistics explores relations between language and culture. Biological\nanthropology examines topics such as community health in the past and present, forensic science, genetics,\nevolution, human biology, and bioethics. Courses cluster around themes of cross-cultural health, biology, food, and\nmedical systems; inequality, power, and social-political relations; material culture, human-environment relations,\nand spatial analysis; religion and politics; and worldviews, language, and cognition. Many courses are\ninterdisciplinary in nature, with connections to programs such as Biology; Earth and Environmental Science;\nMedicine, Health, and Society; Human and Organizational Development; History; Classics and Mediterranean\nStudies; Sociology; Jewish Studies; African American and Diaspora Studies; Latin American Studies; Asian Studies,\nand others, and attracts students from all four Undergraduate colleges.

Chemical biology and biochemistry use\nchemical insight, techniques, and tools to study or manipulate biological systems. They are the cornerstones of\nmedical technology and therapeutics. To provide students with training in modern principles at a chemistry-biology\ninterface, Vanderbilt’s interdisciplinary major in biochemistry and chemical biology incorporates expertise from\nmultiple departments in the university. Students receive a broad background in the natural sciences (chemistry,\nbiology, physics) and mathematics, followed by fundamental core training in principles of biochemistry and chemical\nbiology that involves both theoretical and laboratory course work. Students then pursue an area of emphasis in\neither biochemistry or chemical biology through upper-level elective courses. Students participate in independent\nresearch in laboratories of biochemistry and chemical biology faculty. Additional research experience is available in\nthe Honors Program.\nProgram of Concentration\nThe biochemistry and chemical biology major tracks share fundamental core elements but have a distinct set of\nfoundational courses, track-specific electives, and laboratory requirements.

This is accomplished by\nproviding students with a solid background in the disciplines of organic, analytical, inorganic, biological, and physical\nchemistry. The core courses in these areas, which are supported by a variety of practical experimental experiences\nin the laboratory, provide students with the skills needed to think critically about chemistry. After these core\ncourses, students delve deeper into an area of their choice. Recognizing the importance of research, which\nintegrates and makes sense of our collective body of knowledge, we encourage students to participate in\nundergraduate research. The chemistry major at Vanderbilt University meets the guidelines for the American\nChemical Society approved program of study in chemistry.\nProgram of Concentration in Chemistry\nThe chemistry program is organized into four parts. The first part is a general chemistry course sequence (CHEM\n1601–1602 and 1601L–1602L or AP credit) to serve as an entry point into the major. The second part consists of",

Emphasis is on\ncomputing activities of both practical and intellectual interest, and on theoretical studies of efficient algorithms and\nthe limits of computation. Computer facilities are available for class assignments, team projects, and individual\nstudies.\nStudents are challenged to seek original insights throughout their study. Working in teams, participating in summer\ninternships, supporting student professional organizations, and developing interdisciplinary projects are strongly\nencouraged.\nThe computer science major provides an excellent back- ground for medical studies, and the flexibility provided by\nits many open electives allows students to prepare for medical school while earning a degree in computer science\nwith a normal load in four years. Interested students should discuss their plans with their computer science adviser\nin the fall of their first year.",

Ornes\nCOURSES OFFERED: CSET\nThe Program in Communication of Science and Technology (CSET) sits at the intersection of the sciences and the\nhumanities, and it builds on the vast amount of effort at Vanderbilt devoted to interdisciplinary work that spans the\nnatural sciences, engineering, the social sciences, and the humanities. CSET draws on both the scientific\ncommunities (natural sciences, social sciences, engineering, medicine) and the creative communities (public\nspeaking, writing, digital media production) across multiple colleges at Vanderbilt.\nCSET is designed for students who have an interest in science and technology and also are interested in\ncommunicating science and technology to both peer-professional audiences and to the larger world. CSET is ideal as\na second major for students pursuing a first major in one of the natural sciences, any of several of the social",

Among the natural sciences, ours is the quintessential interdisciplinary science,\nproviding vital perspective on how Earth’s physical and geochemical template simultaneously sustains and\nthreatens life, and influences human interactions with Earth.\nThe Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences (EES) offers an integrated Earth and Environmental Sciences\nundergraduate major leading to the B.A. degree. Students majoring in EES take a core set of science courses with\nlab, computational, and field components, design an academic plan that allows them to develop expertise in an\narea of interest within EES. The comparatively small size of the faculty and student body allows many opportunities\nfor faculty-student interaction.

Our curriculum compels us to recognize the problems\nand possibilities of our current world and also empowers us to affect change.

Some\nfocus on a particular historical period, others on a particular region of the world, and still others on topics that may\ncross traditional chronological and geographical boundaries. The department is committed to the principle that in a\nchanging world, the way we learn about the past must also change. It will continue to develop new courses for the\ntwenty-first century, with an emphasis on those that recognize the interconnections among the various civilizations\nand regions of the globe.\nUnless indicated otherwise in the course description, history courses have no prerequisite. Except for History 3980,\n4960, 4980–4981, and 4999, courses numbered below 5000 are open to all majors and nonmajors. History 4960 is\nlimited to seniors and juniors who have previously taken History 3000W. History 3980, 4980–4981, and 4999 are\nlimited to students who have been admitted to the History Honors Program.\nStudents will find that the study of history offers not only a strong foundation for a liberal education but also a\nmeans of understanding the contemporary world.

Legislation and jurisprudence, for example, allow historians a privileged perspective into how\nsocieties sought to define themselves, their values, and their membership. Constitutions provide maps of political\npower, and serve as sites of struggle over goods both real and symbolic. Records of legal practice are often well\npreserved, allowing access to the voices and actions of people who are usually left out of systems of political\norganization.\nThis major approaches law from both a historical and an interdisciplinary perspective. Emphasis will be placed on\nclose reading of legal documents, research in legal archives, and analytical writing. Students will be encouraged to\ndevelop reading programs and research topics that stretch across national and chronological boundaries, and to\nthink comparatively. Students may not major both in history and in law, history, and society. Students majoring in\nlaw, history, and society may apply to receive honors through the History Honors Program.\nThe major program requires a minimum of 30 credit hours in history; no more than 3 credit hours of AP or IB credit",

A student majoring in physics interested in Honors (Honors in Physics or Honors in\nAstronomy) will work with a faculty mentor to develop an appropriate research project that will be conducted under\nthe guidance of that faculty member. The Honors project must have a substantial grounding in physics or\nastronomy, but may be conducted under the direct supervision of any faculty member in any department at\nVanderbilt. To be admitted to the Honors Program, a student must submit a two-page research proposal describing\nthe plans for their Honors project, which must be approved by the director of the departmental Honors Program. In\naddition, a student must have completed 2953L, either 2255 or 3651, and meet the minimum GPA requirements for\nhonors programs of the College of Arts and Science.\nTo graduate with honors, a student must\nHave at least a 300 cumulative GPA and a 3.300 GPA in courses that count toward the major.\nEarn a minimum of 6 credit hours in research classes (3850, 3851, 4998), leading to an honors thesis, with at\nleast 2 of these credit hours earned in A student who earns credit for 3852 may satisfy this portion of the",

At Vanderbilt, the undergraduate\nprogram introduces students to the major areas of contemporary psychology: clinical science, human cognition and\ncognitive neuroscience, developmental psychology, neuroscience, and social psychology. Clinical science studies\nhuman personality, emotion, abnormal behavior, and therapeutic treatments. Human cognition and cognitive\nneuroscience are the study of processes such as learning, remembering, perceiving objects and events, and neural\nmechanisms underlying these processes. Developmental psychology examines human development from\nconception through adulthood, including cognitive, emotional, physical, and social aspects. Neuroscience studies the\nstructure and function of the brain and how nerve cells process sensory information, mediate decisions, and control\nmotor actions. Social psychology examines interpersonal and intergroup relations and the influence of social\nconditions on cognitive, emotional, and behavioral processes.\nThe Department of Psychology offers a general program of study for students who desire a broad background in\ncontemporary psychology, as well as an honors program. The department offers a wide variety of opportunities for\nundergraduates to gain research experience through active participation in faculty research projects. Such research\nexperience is considered a fundamental aspect of education in psychological science.",

It is one of a few\nindependent universities with both a quality undergraduate program and a full range of graduate and\nprofessional programs. It has a strong faculty of more than 4,200 full-time members and a diverse student body\nof more than 12,800.\nThe 334-acre campus is about one and one-half miles from the downtown business district of the city of Nashville,\ncombining the advantages of an urban location with a peaceful, parklike setting of broad lawns, shaded paths,\nand quiet plazas.",
