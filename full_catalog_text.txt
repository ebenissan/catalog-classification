Immersion Vanderbilt
Immersion Vanderbilt is an innovative program that enhances the undergraduate experience through hands-on
experiential and applied learning. Each student shall complete at least one immersive experience, followed by a
culminating project. At its core, Immersion Vanderbilt gives every Vanderbilt student the opportunity to pursue
intellectual curiosities through immersive experiences and culminating projects that are as creative and unique as
the students. Throughout the Immersion Vanderbilt program, students are supported by faculty and the Immersion
Vanderbilt office.
 
Immersion Vanderbilt is a requirement for all undergraduates. Some majors, minors, programs of study, and classes
are approved to satisfy the immersive experience, culminating project, or both. To complete the Immersion
Vanderbilt requirement, students engage in one or more experiential learning activities, for which the student has a
faculty or staff mentor. The student will complete their immersive experience in one of the six immersion pathways
of their choosing: 1) Research; 2) Study Abroad; 3) Innovation, Arts, & Design; 4) Civic & Community Engagement;
5) Leadership & Professional Development; or 6) Internships. When a student engages in research for Immersion, a
Vanderbilt faculty member must be the mentor. Throughout the program, students are prompted to reflect upon
their immersive experiences, which can inform the development of the culminating project. This reflective process
ensures that students gain a deeper understanding of their immersive experience(s) and its significance to their
goals.
 
Upon completing their immersive experience(s), students plan and complete their culminating project. Although
students are encouraged to base their culminating project on their immersive experience(s), this is not required; the
culminating project can relate to an immersive experience already completed or a new topic. As with the immersive
experience, the student completes their culminating project in one of the six immersion pathways: 1) Research; 2)
Study Abroad; 3) Innovation, Arts, & Design; 4) Civic & Community Engagement; 5) Leadership & Professional
Development; or 6) Internship. The format of the culminating project can take many forms, including oral
presentations, poster presentations, artistic displays at a showcase, performances, design projects, videos,
websites, prototypes, white papers, or senior theses, among others. The Immersion Vanderbilt faculty adviser
guides the creation of the culminating project, assesses its quality, and marks it as complete.
 
When the Immersion Vanderbilt faculty adviser approves the culminating project submission, the Immersion
Vanderbilt requirement is complete and cannot be changed. Completion of the Immersion Vanderbilt graduation
requirement is noted on the student’s degree audit and the student transcript is updated with the culminating
project title and project pathway. More information about Immersion Vanderbilt can be found at:
https://www.vanderbilt.edu/immersion/.
Hoogland Undergraduate Business Program
Vanderbilt University offers a transinstitutional, interdisciplinary undergraduate minor in business that is
administered by the Owen Graduate School of Management. The undergraduate business minor requires 16.5 credit
hours and is directed by Gary Kimball. Professor Kimball also serves as the director of undergraduate studies for the
program.
 
The Hoogland Undergraduate Business Program (BUS) provides students with a rigorous exposure to the
fundamental business disciplines of financial reporting, finance, organizational behavior, marketing, and operations.
The program also intentionally grounds the study of business within the liberal arts tradition, allowing students to
understand the context within which business operates in society.
 
Students declaring the undergraduate business minor (BUS) may not also declare either of the minors in human and
organizational development (HOD) or engineering management (ENGM). Students electing the undergraduate
business minor must follow academic regulations regarding minors in their home school, including but not limited to
regulations regarding unique hours.

Course Descriptions
Undergraduate Minor in Legal Studies
The Undergraduate Minor in Legal Studies, designed and taught by Vanderbilt Law School Faculty, offers a
comprehensive introduction to law for Vanderbilt undergraduate students. Through five courses totaling 15 credits
and supplemental programming, the Minor will enable students to make informed judgments about whether to
pursue law school and legal careers, as well as gain knowledge and skills that will give them a leg up in law school
and their future careers. Students will also graduate with a better understanding of how the law shapes our society.
The Director of the Undergraduate Minor in Legal Studies is Sean B. Seymore, Centennial Professor of Law. Students
pursuing the Undergraduate Minor in Legal Studies will have access to specialized programming throughout the
school year on a variety of Law School topics, including the admissions process, legal career paths, and the graduate
student experience.
 
Students are required to take Introduction to Law and the Legal System, which is offered each semester. They must
also take four additional minor-specific Law School courses, of which at least one will be offered every semester.
One of these four additional courses may be taken from an approved list of non-Law School Vanderbilt University
courses.

General Benefits
Sponsored Activities
Aerospace Courses at TSU
 
 
The Air Force Reserve Officer Training Corps (AFROTC) provides pre-commission training for college men and women
who desire to serve as commissioned officers in the United States Air Force and Space Force. When combined with
the academic disciplines offered at the college level, the program provides the student a broad-based knowledge of
management, leadership, and technical skills required for a commission and subsequent active-duty service in the
Air Force or Space Force. 
 
Graduates are commissioned as Second Lieutenants and will enter active duty. The main objectives of producing
officers through the AFROTC program are (1) to procure officers with a broad educational base, (2) to provide a basic
military education for college students, (3) to teach fundamentals and techniques of leadership, management, and
decision making, and (4) to develop, in conjunction with other academic disciplines, individual character and
attributes required of a commissioned officer in the United States Air Force.

Army Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC)
Military Science Department
Military Science Courses
 
 
The Army Reserve Officers’ Training Corps (ROTC) is a sequential and progressive academic program that provides
pre-commission training for college-educated men and women who desire to serve as commissioned officers in the
active Army, Army Reserve, and Army National Guard. As the Army’s largest commissioning source, it fulfills a vital
role in providing mature young men and women for leadership and management positions in an increasingly
technological Army. Admission is open to both men and women who meet mental, moral, and physical
qualifications.
 
Training goes beyond the typical college classroom and is designed to build individual confidence and self-
discipline, instill values and ethics, and develop leadership skills. The course load consists of one course per
semester. Each succeeding year will address course topics in greater depth as students receive feedback on their
leadership style and assume positions of greater responsibility within the program. Graduates are commissioned as
Second Lieutenants and will enter active duty with follow-on employment in the Army Reserves, National Guard, or
active duty. Educational delays may be granted for graduates who desire to pursue advanced degrees prior to entry
on active duty.
 
All university students in the Nashville area may participate in the Army ROTC program at Vanderbilt University.
While Vanderbilt serves as the host university, students at partnership schools are not charged additional tuition to
take military science courses. Grades are transferred back to each university and added to the students’ transcripts.
 
Scholarships. Students can earn merit scholarships in several ways. High school seniors and graduates compete for
four-year scholarships that are determined by local competition among Vanderbilt applicants. Although determined
locally, the application process is centrally managed. Scholarship students receive financial benefits that cover the
cost of full tuition scholarships each year, an annual $1,200 book allowance, all uniforms, and a monthly tax-free
stipend of $420. Vanderbilt University also provides Vanderbilt ROTC scholarship students an additional $6,000
tuition grant each year for room and board.
 
Students who are not on scholarship receive the monthly stipend during their junior and senior years. All students
Page 26 of 1019 

enrolled in the Army ROTC program are provided textbooks and uniforms at no expense. Contracted non-
scholarship students also receive the monthly stipend $420. For more information, see the website at
goarmy.com/rotc.html.
 
Summer training. Students have the opportunity to attend several training events over the summer.
 
Advanced Camp — This five-week leadership exercise at Fort Knox, Kentucky, is a commissioning requirement. This
is normally done between the junior and senior years. Travel, room, and board are provided free, and cadets are
paid approximately $700.
 
Cultural Understanding and Language Program (CULP) Internships — Students are encouraged to spend a semester,
special or summer session in academic studies abroad if feasible. Special incentives are available to further attract
qualified students to these valuable programs.
 
Cadet Troop and Leadership Training Internships (CTLT) — CTLT Internships are leadership development
opportunities for students who are placed with military organizations throughout the world to gain perspective and
understanding on the role of the military officer.
 
Cadet Professional Field Training (CPFT) — Airborne, Air Assault, Mountain Warfare, Robin Sage (U.S. Special
Forces), Helicopter Flight Training, and Sapper.
 
Other training opportunities exist for qualified applicants who are interested.
 
Commissioning and career opportunities. A commission in the U.S. Army is a distinctive honor earned through hard
work, demonstrated commitment, and a desire to serve the nation. Post-graduate military education, usually
starting within six months of graduation and commissioning and continuing through the officer’s service career,
begins with the basic officer leadership course followed by officer basic course that qualify new lieutenants in their
specific branch of service. Education delays are available for critical specialties requiring postgraduate civilian
education such as law and medical degrees.
 
Course credit. During the four-year program, Army ROTC students complete eight courses of military science plus
associated labs. Academic credit varies by university.
 
Vanderbilt University College Credit: All AROTC courses count toward elective credit. See course descriptions below.

MS-PC 1210. Leadership and Personal Development. Leadership is one of the most compelling topics of our
time, and might be one of the most important attributes for effectiveness in all levels of human endeavor. The
success of one of the most admired and respected institutions in our country, the military, is founded upon the
understanding and effective application of leadership, and the development of leaders. This course introduces
students to the personal challenges and competencies that are critical to effective leadership. The focus is on
developing basic knowledge and comprehension of leadership attributes and core leader competencies in a
universal setting and exploring potential applications of these principles and practices at Vanderbilt, in the military
and in the corporate world. [1]
 
MS-PC 1210L. Leadership and Personal Development Lab. Leader development is a continuous process of
training, assessment and feedback with the goal of instilling and enhancing desirable behavior in individuals and
organizations. Within the military science curriculum, this process is called the Leadership Development Program
(LDP), modeled after the principles spelled out in Field Manual 22-100, Army Leadership, and is standardized both
on campus and in Advanced Camp environments. The flexible methodology of LDP accommodates personalized,
individual development at all levels of proficiency throughout the officer educational experience, from program
entry to commissioning. The LDP includes basic leadership training, periodic assessment and counseling at both
team and individual levels by experienced observers. Trends and deficiencies are identified and addressed with
retraining and reassessment in a continuous cycle. Effective leader development is progressive, building on lessons
learned and maximizing individual potential. This course introduces students to the leadership development process
by providing structured leadership opportunities in a variety of training settings. Student performance in leadership
roles is assessed and notable strengths and weaknesses are identified. A plan for improvement is discussed in detail
during one-on-one counseling sessions. [1]
 
MS-PC 1230. Leadership and Personal Development II. What motivates others to follow a person is intriguing,
inspiring and alluring. Through routine observation, we learn from leaders regardless of the setting (military,
business, education, etc.). Leadership and Personal Development II provides an overview of leadership
fundamentals such as setting direction, problem solving, listening and providing feedback. You will explore
dimensions of leadership, values, attributes, skills, and actions in a military context through practical, hands-on, and
interactive exercises. [1]

Naval Reserve Officers' Training Corps (NROTC)
Naval Science
Naval Science Courses
 
 
The Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps (NROTC) unit at Vanderbilt conducts the Naval Officer Education program.
Challenging academic courses and experience-building events prepare a select group of highly accomplished
students for the opportunity to serve their country as a Navy or Marine Corps officer and receive an education. The
primary focus of the NROTC program is to develop the most capable leaders possible by building upon the academic
strength of Vanderbilt and providing essential military and leadership education.
 
Students participate in the NROTC unit in the scholarship program, the college program, or the naval science
program. College Program students take the prescribed naval science course each semester, participate weekly in
naval science lab, and engage in summer training programs after each academic year. The NROTC College Program
is identical to the scholarship program except for tuition financial benefit and that students only participate in
summer training upon completion of their junior academic year. Also, any Vanderbilt student may take any or all of
the naval science courses without participating in naval science lab or summer training.
 
Scholarship students receive tuition, fees, uniforms, $375 per semester for textbooks, and a monthly stipend
beginning at $250 for freshmen and increasing to $400 for seniors. Vanderbilt may provide scholarship students
with up to a $6,000-per-year stipend toward room and board. College Program students are provided uniforms,
textbooks for naval science courses, and a monthly stipend of $350 upon commencement of their junior year with
approval by higher authority based on academic performance and military aptitude.
Page 30 of 1019 

Scholarships. Students can earn scholarships in several ways. Four-year scholarships are determined by national
competition among high school  seniors and graduates. Based on the national ranking, students may be awarded a
scholarship that covers full tuition. To be eligible, applicants must  have less than 30 semester hours of college
credit. College Program students can also be nominated for three- and two-year scholarships by the  NROTC unit.
These nominations are based on the students’ academic and military performance at the college level. Sophomores
not enrolled in the  College Program are eligible to apply for the two-year NROTC scholarship program. This is a
national competition and application is made through the  NROTC unit.
Service obligation. For most students at the beginning of their sophomore year, should they choose to continue with
the NROTC program, Navy option scholarship students incur a minimum service obligation of five years active duty,
and Marine option scholarship students incur a minimum service  obligation of four years of active duty, to be
served upon graduation or withdrawal from the program. College Program students incur a three-year  active duty
commitment upon graduation or withdrawal from the program. Additional requirements may be required for specific
job assignments. 
 
Summer training. Summer training for three to four weeks is conducted aboard naval vessels and naval shore
stations after each of the first three  academic years. Scholarship students are normally required to participate each
year. All scholarship and College Program midshipmen are required to  participate in summer training prior to their
final academic year.
Course credit. During the four-year program, NROTC Navy-option students are required to complete eight courses
(24 hours) of naval science, and Marine-option students are required to complete six courses (18 hours) of naval
science. Academic credit awarded varies by course and is outlined in the course descriptions below.
 
Required Courses for Navy/Marine Scholarship. The following courses are required for students on scholarship:

The admissions process for first-year applicants to Vanderbilt is holistic in nature and based on students’ academic
records and personal accomplishments. All available information is considered, including secondary school
academic record, evidence of academic maturity and independence, extracurricular activities, contributions to and
impact on the school and community, scores on standardized tests if submitted (see #3 in Application Procedure
below), and letters of recommendation.
 
The admissions process supports the university's mission of scholarship and discovery and is designed to select a
student body with exceptional academic talent, high standards of personal character, serious educational aims, and
wide-ranging backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives. Policies that govern the selection process have been set
Page 32 of 1019 

by the vice provost for university enrollment affairs. Please refer to the nondiscrimination statement which appears
earlier in this catalog.
 
Admission to the four undergraduate schools is managed by the Office of Undergraduate Admissions.
 
Prospective students are encouraged to investigate the university by visiting the campus, exploring the Office of

hosted by Vanderbilt admissions officers across the country, around the world, and online. Admissions staff are
available to answer questions, assist with understanding campus visit opportunities, provide additional information
about degree programs, and link visitors with appropriate campus offices and members of the university community.
Academic Preparation
Every candidate for admission must present an official transcript of work completed in high school. While our
admissions process is holistic, most successful candidates will present a curriculum that includes the equivalent of
five academic subjects each year for four years. Recommended course work includes 4 units of English, 4 units of
mathematics, 4 units of natural science, 2 units of foreign language, 2 units of social science/humanities, and 4 units
of additional course work in these areas, or other academic courses such as engineering science, computer science,
social science or natural science research, or advanced work in the humanities. Close attention will be paid to the
rigor of course work presented. It is highly recommended that candidates applying to the School of Engineering have
taken calculus, calculus-based physics, and chemistry.
 
Most successful candidates will have meaningfully engaged with the academic, intellectual, social, and leadership
opportunities available in the context of their high schools and communities. In exceptionally rare cases, students
may be considered for admission before completing four years of high school. In these cases, the Admissions
Committee considers especially evidence of maturity and readiness for an immersive, residential college
experience.

requirements of the university. (See “Application Procedure” above, for first-year and for transfer applicants.)
 
Applicants whose first language or language of instruction is not English are required to submit the results of the
Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL) iBT (including Home and Paper editions) TOEFL Essentials, the
International English Language Testing Service (IELTS), the Pearson Test of English Academic (PTE Academic), the
Duolingo English Test (DET), or the Cambridge English C1 Advanced or C2 Proficiency. This testing requirement may
be waived if a student has scored above a 26 on the ACT English section or above 630 on the SAT Evidence-based
Reading and Writing section. Minimum recommended scores for Vanderbilt are 100 TOEFL iBT, 10.5 on the TOEFL
Essentials, 7.0 on the IELTS, 70 on the PTE Academic, 130 on the Duolingo English Test, and 185 on the Cambridge

Advanced Credit
Honors courses and other accelerated study in high school are excellent preparation for Vanderbilt. The well-
established advanced-placement policy endeavors to recognize exceptional high school preparation, to avoid
requiring first-year students to take courses clearly mastered in high school, and to encourage students to begin
their college learning experience at the level most appropriate to their preparation. Advanced placement may be
granted on the basis of good performance on the College Board Advanced Placement Examinations, on International
Baccalaureate tests, or, in some cases, on placement tests given by Vanderbilt. Credit may also be awarded for the
British G.C.E. “A” level examinations, the Advanced International Certificate of Education (AICE), the Cambridge Pre-
U diploma, and similar tests, such as the French baccalauréat, the German abitur, or the Swiss maturité
examinations. To qualify for credit for the AICE examinations or individual A-level examinations, students must have
achieved an A*, A, or B thereon. More information on international exam credit is available at
registrar.vanderbilt.edu/international-examinations.
 
College Entrance Exams
Students may not take college entrance exams after they begin their enrollment at Vanderbilt University for the
purpose of course placement or academic credit. This applies to SAT, ACT, Advanced Placement, International
Baccalaureate, and any similar international exams.
 
Advanced Placement Credit Policy
Advanced Placement Examination grades accepted for advanced placement with credit by the various departments
at Vanderbilt are listed below. At the determination of individual departments, Advanced Placement Examination
grades with a score of 4 or 5 may be accepted for credit. The amount of credit that may be awarded corresponds to
the course work waived. Advanced Placement credit does not affect the Vanderbilt grade point average.
 
Students of the College of Arts and Science are limited to a total of 18 credit hours earned by any combination of
advanced placement, international baccalaureate credit, advanced international credit, and credit by departmental
examination, counting toward the minimum number of hours required toward the degree. For students in the
College of Arts and Science, no form of advanced placement credit can be used to fulfill the Achieving Excellence in
Liberal Education (AXLE) requirements.
 
International Baccalaureate Credit Policy
International Baccalaureate test scores accepted for advanced credit by the various departments at Vanderbilt are
listed below. Students who have taken tests in other areas may submit their scores to the Office of Academic
Services for evaluation by the appropriate departments. Credits are awarded for exams taken at the higher level
only. The amount of credit that may be awarded is subject to the same limitations as credit for Advanced Placement.

Pre-College Summer School Program
Upon completion of the sophomore or junior year in high school, students may enroll, at the freshman level, for
regular work in the Vanderbilt summer session.
 
The following conditions must be met: (a) students must be in the upper 25 percent of their high school class and be
recommended by their principal or counselor; (b) courses taken in the Vanderbilt summer session must be chosen
by the student in consultation with his or her high school counselor and the director of the Division of Unclassified
Studies so as to supplement and not overlap the total high school program. A student may take two courses in any
one summer, or three courses by special authorization of the director of the Division of Unclassified Studies.
 
Course work done at Vanderbilt by a pre-college student may count toward the high school diploma and as part of
the entrance requirements for regular admission to Vanderbilt. All course work done at Vanderbilt by pre-college
students will be credited toward the degree for those who may subsequently matriculate at Vanderbilt, unless the
course work is required for high school graduation. Admission to the pre-college summer school program does not
admit a student as a regular entering freshman, nor does it commit the university to a student’s admission.
 
Credit for Previous College Work
Entering first-year students who have taken college work in high school through dual enrollment or concurrent
enrollment programs, or during summers prior to their offer of admission to Vanderbilt, must indicate such work on
the undergraduate admission application. An official transcript showing any prior college work must be provided.
Once all required documentation has been received, the coursework will be reviewed to determine whether it is
eligible for credit at Vanderbilt.
 
Students should submit all required documentation for review before the first day of classes of their freshman year.
 
Credit will be awarded only if:
1. A course is regularly offered by an accredited two-year or four-year college or university. For domestic
schools, the school must be regionally accredited; for international schools, the school must have country-
specific accreditation.
2. The teacher was a regular faculty member of that college or university.
3. A majority of the students in the course were degree-seeking college students.
Additional requirements and guidelines regarding pre-freshman credit are available
at registrar.vanderbilt.edu/transfer-credit.php.
 
The College of Arts and Science and Peabody College usually do not award credit for work at other colleges in the
summer immediately preceding the student’s first semester at Vanderbilt. Summer work elsewhere will be accepted
for credit only if an unusual educational opportunity can be demonstrated and if the courses sought are as rigorous
as courses offered at Vanderbilt. Approval for work to be taken elsewhere must be obtained in advance from the
appropriate dean.
 
Page 41 of 1019 

College of Arts and Science. In no case may credits completed elsewhere after the student has been offered
admission by the College of Arts and Science satisfy AXLE requirements.
International Students
Vanderbilt has a large international community representing more than 95 countries. The university welcomes the
diversity international students bring to the campus and encourages academic and social interactions at all levels.
 
Admission. See International Applicants section.
 
English Language Instruction. Students wishing to focus on improving their English language use for the context of
the U.S. academic setting may take classes and participate in programming at the Vanderbilt English Language
Center to support their academic success. The ELC’s courses include writeELC, Academic Speaking, and
Pronunciation. Throughout the academic year, academic workshops and one-to-one consultations for speaking and
writing are also available through the ELC. Entering students may be required to take language support courses
concurrently with their academic courses at the ELC. The ELC is located at 1208 18th Avenue South. For information
about the ELC’s programming, see the “English Language Center” section or visit vanderbilt.edu/elc.
 
Financial Resources. To meet requirements for entry into the United States for study, applicants must demonstrate
that they have sufficient financial resources to meet the expected costs of their educational program. Applicants
must provide documentary evidence of their financial resources before visa documents can be issued.
 
United States laws and regulations restrict the opportunity for international students in a non-immigrant visa status
to be employed. Undergraduate international students are allowed to work on campus for nineteen hours per week
while school is in session. Students may be allowed to work off campus only under special circumstances and after
approval from ISSS. Many spouses and dependents of international students are not allowed to be employed while in
the United States.
 
Limited need-based financial aid is available to students who are neither citizens nor permanent residents of the
United States, and are considered to be international students in Vanderbilt’s admissions process. Our admissions
process is need-aware for international students; international students who demonstrate that they can afford the
cost of attending Vanderbilt will be given preferential treatment. To apply for need-based financial aid, international
students are required to submit the College Scholarship Service (CSS) Financial Aid Profile. Based upon an
evaluation of academic qualities, financial need, and availability of resources, an international student may be
considered for need-based financial assistance. International students who apply for need-based financial aid will be
admitted only if they are competitive in our holistic review and if Vanderbilt is able to provide adequate financial
assistance.
 
International Student Health Insurance. International students are required to have health insurance throughout
their academic program and are automatically enrolled in the Vanderbilt-approved health insurance plan for
international students. For information concerning the limits, exclusions, and benefits of this insurance coverage,
please contact the Student Health Center.
Page 42 of 1019 

Transfer Credit
Work presented for transfer must be from an accredited college and is subject to evaluation in light of the degree
requirements of this university. For domestic schools, the school must be regionally accredited; for international
schools, the school must have country-specific accreditation. 
 
Work transferred to Vanderbilt from another institution will not carry with it a grade point average. No course in
which a grade below C– was received will be credited toward a degree offered by the university.  
 
College of Arts and Science. Transfer students must complete at least 60 hours of work in the College of Arts and
Science. Credit earned as a degree-seeking student at another university may be used to fulfill AXLE requirements. 
 
Blair School of Music. In addition to an application for admission, transfer students applying to Blair must also
submit a Blair School of Music Application, which includes a required prescreening video, by the March 15 deadline.
Selected applicants will be invited to audition in person. See the Blair website for information and instructions about
the Blair admissions process. Transfer students will be assigned a level of program study based on the entrance
audition. Credit for music courses may be granted following an examination at Blair. Credit for non- music courses is
subject to evaluation by the university. Transfer students must complete at least 63 hours at Blair. 
 
School of Engineering. Transfer students must complete at least 60 hours of work at Vanderbilt.
 
Peabody College. Transfer students must complete at least 60 hours of work at Peabody. Two of the four semesters
in residence must be the last two semesters of the student’s degree program. 
Prior Degrees
It is the policy of Vanderbilt University to verify prior educational credentials for all admitted students who intend to
matriculate. All matriculated students must provide official copies of transcripts and any other required supporting
documentation to Vanderbilt University as part of the prior degree verification process. The Office of the University
Registrar will review transcripts and other supporting documentation for authenticity and to confirm degrees earned
prior to matriculation at Vanderbilt. Offers of admission are contingent on a student’s providing the required
documentation. Undergraduate students who are not able to provide evidence of prior degrees will not be permitted
to register for subsequent terms and may be subject to dismissal from the university.
Page 43 of 1019 

Intra-University Transfer
Undergraduate students in the College of Arts and Science, Blair School of Music, School of Engineering, and
Peabody College may request a transfer between the schools. Students are eligible for intra-university transfer after
having been enrolled on a full-time basis at Vanderbilt for two semesters. Students who transferred to Vanderbilt
from another institution are eligible for intra-university transfer after having completed at least one full semester at
Vanderbilt and having achieved sophomore standing. To be eligible for transfer, students must meet the
requirements of the school they wish to enter.
 
Applications are available on the Office of the University Registrar website, registrar.vanderbilt.edu/intra-university-
transfers/, and should be submitted to the Office of the University Registrar by the required deadlines listed on this
webpage.
 
Students seeking transfer between schools within the university must meet the following requirements: (a) a
student who has been in residence for two regular semesters must have a minimum of 24 hours and a cumulative
grade point average of 1.800; (b) a student who has been in residence for three regular semesters must have a
minimum of 39 hours and a cumulative grade point average of 1.850; (c) a student who has been in residence for
four regular semesters must have a minimum of 54 hours and a cumulative grade point average of 1.900; (d) a
student who has been in residence for five regular semesters must have a minimum of 69 hours and a cumulative
grade point average of 1.950.
 
Individual schools and/or majors may impose additional restrictions beyond the minimum requirements listed above.
Students applying to the Blair School of Music must audition as part of the process. Transfer applicants to the School
of Engineering should present at least two semesters of college calculus and two semesters of laboratory- based
science as required in the intended major. Advanced Placement or International Baccalaureate credit, if accepted by
Vanderbilt, can be used to meet these requirements.
Page 44 of 1019 

Division of Unclassified Studies
The Division of Unclassified Studies provides an opportunity to take undergraduate courses at Vanderbilt as follows:
a. adults not interested in working toward a degree,
b. visiting students working toward a degree at another institution (students in this category may not remain
enrolled in the division for more than two regular semesters and one summer session), and
c. rising junior and senior students in high school who have received special permission to enroll in courses for
college credit.
Such students register in the Division of Unclassified Studies. Records are kept of their work, and a transcript may be
made available to them as it would be if they were regularly enrolled at Vanderbilt. Work taken in the division may
be transferred to a degree-granting unit of the university provided it is work that will count as part of the program of
that unit. Work so transferred may not amount to more than one-fourth of the requirements for the Vanderbilt
degree. Requests for transfer to a Vanderbilt degree-granting school must be made to the Office of Undergraduate
Admissions. Division of Unclassified Studies students are not eligible for intra-university transfer.
 
Students who want to enroll in the Division of Unclassified Studies must apply and be admitted to the division at
least one week before the first day of classes for the term or session they wish to attend. Requests for exceptions to
the admission criteria must be addressed in writing to the vice provost for university enrollment affairs and dean of
admissions and financial aid, whose decision is final.
 
All university regulations, including the Honor System, apply to students registered in the Division of Unclassified
Studies.
 
Degree candidates have priority in enrollment at Vanderbilt, and students registering in the Division of Unclassified
Studies should be prepared for this contingency. DUS students must meet all course prerequisites. Permission of the
Office of the Dean is required for enrollment in some courses. Tuition is charged at the standard rate.
 
Division of Unclassified Studies students are not charged health insurance fees, and do not have access to student
health services. 
Summer Session
The ten-week summer session begins in early June and ends early in August. In addition, some units of the
university offer an accelerated four-week Maymester. Vanderbilt offers the summer program for regularly enrolled
students at the university, for part-time students, and for students enrolled during the regular year in other colleges
and universities (visiting students). 
 
Summer courses are normally offered by the College of Arts and Science, Blair School of Music, the School of
Engineering, the Graduate School, the School of Nursing, and Peabody College. 
 
Some courses extend over the entire summer session and complete the work of a full semester. Others are offered
in modular units of eight, six, five, or four weeks, for full semester credit. Still other summer courses complete a full
semester’s work in the first five-week or second five-week half of summer session, with classes meeting twice as
many hours per week. In full-year courses offered in summer, the work of the first semester is covered in the first
half-session, the work of the second semester in the second half. 
 
Classrooms, residence halls, libraries, and dining halls are air conditioned. The David Williams II Student Recreation
and Wellness Center and other athletic facilities are open in the summer. Information about the summer session is
available on request from the Division of Unclassified Studies or from each school’s Office of Academic Services.
Students may also visit vanderbilt.edu/summer for additional information.

Maymester
In the interval of several weeks between final examinations in the spring semester and the beginning of summer
session, Vanderbilt offers educational travel opportunities and a variety of courses that would be difficult to offer
during a regular semester.
 
Students are permitted to take no more than one course during the Maymester. Housing and food services are
available during the session. Visiting students are eligible for Maymester courses.

Need-Based Financial Aid
Vanderbilt is committed to accessibility and affordability for all admitted and enrolled students. Grants, scholarships,
and work opportunities are available to eligible students who apply for assistance and have demonstrated financial
need. Beginning in the fall of 2009, financial aid packages offered to incoming and current undergraduate students
no longer included need-based loans. While continuing to meet the full demonstrated need of all eligible students,
this expanded aid initiative, Opportunity Vanderbilt, announced in October 2008 provides increased amounts of
need- based grants and/or scholarships (gift assistance) to replace need-based loans that would have otherwise
been offered to meet a student’s demonstrated financial need.
 
Demonstrated financial need is the difference between the cost of attending Vanderbilt and the amount that
students and their families are expected to contribute toward that cost. The amount of aid to fully meet each
student’s demonstrated financial need is determined annually on the basis of current financial information
required/provided on relevant application forms.

Undergraduate Academic Regulations
Institutional Policies and Student Obligations
Honor System (A&S, Blair, VUSE, PBDY)
Arts & Science/Blair/Engineering/Peabody: All academic work at Vanderbilt is done under the Honor System.
(See the chapter on Life at Vanderbilt.)
Responsibility to be Informed (VUSE)
Engineering: It is the responsibility of the student to keep informed of course requirements and scheduling. Failure
to do so may jeopardize graduation.
Class Attendance (A&S, Blair, VUSE, PBDY)
Arts & Science: Students are expected to attend all scheduled meetings of classes in which they are enrolled; they
have an obligation to contribute to the academic performance of all students by full participation in the work of each
class. At the beginning of the semester, instructors explain the policy regarding absences in each of their classes,
and thereafter they report to the Dean’s Office of Undergraduate Education in the College of Arts and Science the
name of any student whose achievement in a course is being adversely affected by excessive absences. In such
cases an associate dean, in consultation with the instructor, takes appropriate action, which may include dropping
the student from the class; students dropped after the deadline for withdrawal (see Period for Withdrawal) receive
the grade F. Class attendance may be specified as a factor in determining the final grade in a course, and it cannot
fail to influence the grade even when it is not considered explicitly.
 
Page 56 of 1019 

The last day before and the first day after official holidays are considered to be the same as any other day on which
classes are scheduled. Assignments are made for classes scheduled on these days, and tests may be given in them.
Students should take this fact into account in making travel plans.
 
The faculty of the College of Arts and Science recognizes that occasions arise during the academic year that merit
the excused absence of a student from a scheduled class or laboratory during which an examination, quiz, or other
graded exercise is given. Examples include participation in sponsored university activities (e.g., debate team,
varsity sports), observance of officially designated religious holidays, serious personal problems (e.g., serious
illness, death of a member of the student’s family), and matters relating to the student’s academic training (e.g.,
graduate or professional school interviews). While determination of the merit of a case is left primarily to the
discretion of the individual instructor, conflicts arising from personal travel plans or social obligations do not qualify
as excused absences. The Dean’s Office of Undergraduate Education does not grant excused absences for students.
For more information please visit as.vanderbilt.edu/academics/policies/absences.php.
 
The primary determination of whether a student’s absence from class occurs for a reason that warrants
rescheduling a graded exercise for that student is left to the judgment of the individual instructor. A standard of
reasonableness should apply in making such judgments.
 
Except in cases of true emergency, student petitions for making up missed graded exercises must be made prior to
the missed class, preferably at the beginning of the semester or at the earliest time thereafter when the need to be
absent is known to the student. Faculty members retain discretion in the form and timing of makeup exercises or in
devising other strategies for accommodating students.
 
The faculty of the College of Arts and Science authorizes the Office of the Dean to resolve through arbitration any
cases that cannot be directly resolved between students and their instructors.
 
Blair: Students are expected to attend all sessions of each class in which they are enrolled. Attendance is usually a
factor in determining the final grade in a course. A student who fails to abide by the attendance policy set by the
course instructor is subject to removal from the course. The last day before and the first day after official holidays
are considered to be the same as any other day on which classes are scheduled. Assignments are made for classes
scheduled on these days, and tests may be given in them. Students should take this fact into account in making
travel plans.
 
Engineering: Students are expected to attend all scheduled meetings of each class in which they are enrolled. At
the beginning of each semester, instructors will explain the policy regarding absences in each of their classes.
Students having excessive absences will be reported to the Office of the Dean. Class attendance may be a factor in
determining the final grade in a course.
 
Peabody: Students are expected to attend all scheduled meetings of classes in which they are enrolled; they have
an obligation to contribute to the academic performance of all students by full participation in the work of each
class. At the beginning of the semester, instructors explain the policy regarding absences in each of their classes,
and thereafter they report to the office of the dean of the college the name of any student whose achievement in a
course is being adversely affected by excessive absences. In such cases, the dean, in consultation with the
instructor, takes appropriate action, which may include dropping the student from the class; students dropped after
the deadline for withdrawal receive the grade F. Class attendance may be specified as a factor in determining the
final grade in a course, and it cannot fail to influence the grade even when it is not considered explicitly.
Classroom Recording Policy (A&S, Blair)
Arts & Science/Blair: The use of technologies for audio and video recording of lectures and other classroom
activities is allowed only with the express permission of the instructor. In cases where recordings are allowed, such
content is restricted to personal use only unless permission is expressly granted in writing by the instructor and by
Page 57 of 1019 

other classroom participants, including other students. Personal use is defined as use by an individual student for
the purpose of studying or completing course assignments. When students have permission for personal use of
recordings, they must still obtain written permission from the instructor to share recordings with others.
 
For students registered with the Office of Student Access Services and who have been approved for audio and/or
video recording of lectures and other classroom activities as a reasonable accommodation, applicable federal law
requires instructors to permit those recordings. Such recordings are also limited to personal use, except with
permission of the instructor and other students in the class.
Academic Advising (Blair, VUSE, PBDY)
Blair: All entering students are assigned academic advisers who assist in the planning of programs and course
schedules. Students are required to meet with their advisers prior to registration for each semester.
 
Engineering: A faculty adviser is appointed for each student. This adviser is chosen from the faculty in the
student’s major, when the major is known. For students who have not chosen a major upon entry, an adviser who
specializes in helping undeclared students explore different pathways and decide upon a major is assigned. If a
student later chooses a different department for his or her major, a corresponding change of adviser is made.
Engineering students are required to see their advisers at registration and any other time changes must be made in
their programs of study. Any student who has academic difficulty is expected to see his or her faculty adviser for
counsel. Faculty advisers can also provide useful career guidance.
 
Peabody: Each Peabody undergraduate is assigned an academic adviser who is familiar with his or her major. This
adviser is generally a faculty member in the major department and is knowledgeable about the courses the student
will need to complete his or her major. The adviser helps the student determine the courses that are most suitable
for the chosen major and serves as a mentor to the student.
 
However, enrollment in appropriate courses to fulfill degree requirements and knowledge of university policies and
regulations regarding courses are the responsibility of the individual student.

Arts & Science: A period is designated in each semester during which continuing students, after consultation with
their advisers, register for work to be taken during the next term. The student’s adviser must release the advising
hold in YES before the student can register.
 
Students are asked to plan their immediate and long-range educational programs with their advisers before
registering and to consult their advisers when they make changes in their registration.
 
Students not meeting specified tuition payment deadlines are not permitted to register. See the chapter on Financial
Information for details.
Before registering, students should check their own records carefully with respect to the following items:
1. AXLE requirements;
2. Major requirements;
3. Requirements of any optional minor(s) sought;
4. Course prerequisites.
Blair: Registration is available to entering first-year students in June. Continuing students register on dates
specified each semester in the University Calendar and as assigned in “YES” (Your Enrollment
Services, yes.vanderbilt.edu). Conferences with faculty advisers are required before students may register. Detailed
information on registration is available on the University Registrar
website, registrar.vanderbilt.edu/registration/registration-info.php. Prior to registration, students should refer to the
sample curriculum plans in the Blair Student Handbook.
 
Records and the degree audit should be checked regarding progress toward completing the following:
1. Music core
2. Liberal arts core
3. Additional major area requirements
A student whose registration choices are denied or altered (full or cancelled class, lack of prerequisite courses, etc.)
may select alternate courses during the Open Enrollment registration period.
 
Engineering: A period is designated in each semester during which continuing students, after consultation with
their advisers, register for work to be taken during the next term. Students can access their registration
appointment times and the registration system via YES (Your Enrollment Services) at yes.vanderbilt.edu.
Normal Course Load (A&S, Blair, VUSE, PBDY)
Arts & Science: Each semester, regular tuition is charged on the basis of a normal course load of 12 to 18
semester hours. No more than 18 or fewer than 12 credit hours may be taken in any one semester without
authorization of the Administrative Committee or an associate dean in 350 Buttrick Hall. (There is an extra charge
for more than 18 credit hours at the current hourly rate.) First-year students may not take more than 18 credit hours
in a semester.
 
Students permitted to take fewer than 12 credit hours are placed on probation, unless their light load is necessary
because of outside employment or illness. During the summer session, there is no minimum course load. Summer
loads exceeding 14 credit hours must be authorized by an associate dean in 350 Buttrick Hall.
 
Credit hours are semester hours; e.g., a three-hour course carries credit of 3 semester hours. One semester credit
hour represents at least three hours of academic work per week, on average, for one semester. Academic work
includes, but is not necessarily limited to, lectures, laboratory work, homework, research, class readings,
independent study, internships, practica, studio work, recitals, practicing, rehearsing, and recitations. Some
Vanderbilt courses may have requirements that exceed this definition.
Page 59 of 1019 

 
A student must be enrolled in a minimum of 12 credit hours to be classified as a full-time student.
 
Blair: Tuition is charged on the basis of a normal course load of 12 to 18 semester hours. Course loads outside the
norm, which must be recommended by the student’s adviser and approved by the associate dean, are charged at
an hourly tuition rate. Students who enroll in fewer than 12 hours are placed on probation, unless their underload is
necessary because of outside employment or illness. The maximum course load for the summer session is 12 hours
(6 hours for a summer half-session). A student must be enrolled in a minimum of 12 hours to be classified as a full-
time student.
 
Engineering: Each semester, regular tuition is charged on the basis of a normal course load of 12 to 18 semester
hours. No more than 18 or fewer than 12 hours may be taken in any one semester without authorization from the
senior associate dean.
There is an extra charge for more than 18 hours at the current hourly rate. Students permitted to take fewer than
12 hours are placed on probation, unless their light load is necessary because of illness or outside employment and
is approved by the senior associate dean. A student must be enrolled in a minimum of 12 hours to be classified as a
full-time student.
 
Peabody: A student must be enrolled in a minimum of 12 hours to be classified as a full-time student. Students
wishing to carry more than 18 hours must obtain the approval of the Associate Dean for Undergraduate Academic
Affairs. All undergraduate students are assumed to be full-time students for the purpose of administering probation
and retention policies. A student who for reasons of health, family, or outside employment wishes to enroll in
Peabody as a part-time student must obtain permission from the Associate Dean for Undergraduate Academic
Affairs. The academic standing of such students will be considered on an individual basis. Normally, however, a
student earning less than 12 hours will be placed on academic probation.
Change of Course (Blair, VUSE)
Blair: Course changes may be made during the Open Enrollment period or the official Change Period (Drop/Add) as
published in the University Calendar. All changes need the adviser’s approval. A course dropped during the Change
Period does not show on a transcript.
 
A course may be dropped or changed from P/F to graded status prior to the deadline for withdrawal published in the
University Calendar. The approval of the adviser and associate dean is required (see Grading System regarding
withdrawal grades). Regularly enrolled students must maintain a minimum course load of 12 hours.
 
Engineering: During the change period of registration as defined in the Academic Calendar, students may add or
drop courses without academic penalty. No record of courses dropped during the change period appears on the
academic record. After the change period, new courses may not be added, except under very unusual
circumstances and with the approval of the adviser, the course instructor, and the senior associate dean.
Pass/Fail (A&S, Blair, VUSE, PBDY)
Arts & Science: Students may elect to take a limited number of courses on a Pass/Fail (P/F) basis. To enroll for a
course on a Pass/Fail basis, students must have achieved at least sophomore standing, and must not be on
academic probation. A minimum 12 graded credit hours is required.
 
A graduating senior who has permission to take fewer than 12 credit hours on a graded basis may take one course
on a P/F basis in addition to the courses required for graduation. If the student does not graduate at the end of that
semester, the P grade is automatically converted to the grade actually earned.
 
Page 60 of 1019 

No more than 18 credit hours graded P may be counted toward the degree, and no more than one course per term
may be taken P/F.
 
The P/F option does not apply to courses in the following categories:
1. Courses counted toward AXLE requirements;
2. Courses in the major field(s), other courses that may be counted toward the major(s), or courses required for
the major(s);
3. For students with a defined interdisciplinary major, courses that are required for the major or that are eligible
to count toward the major;
4. For students with an individually designed interdisciplinary major, courses listed in the student’s plan of
study;
5. For students planning an optional minor, courses in the minor field or those eligible to count toward an
interdisciplinary minor;
6. Courses eligible to count toward the major or minor, regardless of whether the student has already satisfied
major or minor requirements;
7. Courses that have been specifically excluded from the P/F option;
8. Courses taken previously.
Students may elect grading on a Pass/Fail basis or change from Pass/Fail to graded status until the deadline date for
withdrawing from a course that is published in the Academic Calendar. Pass/Fail rules, requirements, and deadlines
are not petitionable.
 
Those electing the Pass/Fail option must meet all course requirements (e.g. reports, papers, examinations,
attendance, etc.) and are graded in the normal way. Instructors are not informed of the names of students enrolled
on a Pass/Fail basis. At the end of the semester, a regular grade is submitted for the student enrolled under the P/F
option. Any grade of D– or above is converted in the Student Records System to a P, while an F will be recorded if a
student enrolled under this option fails the course. The P grade is not counted in the grade point average nor used
in the determination of honors. The grade of F earned under the Pass/Fail option is included in the calculation of the
grade point average.
 
The grade for a class will be converted from P to the recorded letter grade if a student later declares a major or
minor toward which that class counts. The recorded letter grade will be included in both the overall and the major or
minor grade point average.
 
Blair: Students may elect to take a limited number of courses on a Pass/Fail (P/F) basis. To enroll for a course on a
Pass/Fail basis, students must have completed at least two semesters at Vanderbilt, must have achieved at least
sophomore standing, and must not be on academic probation. The Blair Office of Academic Services can assist with
P/F registration.
 
For B.Mus. and B.Mus.Arts students, the Pass/Fail option is limited to courses taken as free electives. Course work in
the area of a minor or second major is governed by the school in which the department or program is housed. No
more than one course may be elected on a Pass/Fail basis in any one semester. Only a total of 18 hours towards the
126-hour degree total may be taken on a Pass/Fail basis. Students electing course work on a Pass/Fail basis must be
enrolled for 12 graded hours. A graduating senior who has permission to take fewer than 12 hours on a graded basis
may take one course on a P/F basis in addition to the courses required for graduation. If the student does not
graduate at the end of that semester, the grade P is automatically converted to the grade actually earned.
 
Students may register for grading on a Pass/Fail basis and may change from Pass/Fail to graded status until the
deadline date for withdrawing from a course that is published in the Academic Calendar.
 
Those electing the Pass/Fail option must meet all course requirements (e.g., reports, papers, examinations,
attendance, etc.) and are graded in the normal way. Instructors are not informed of the names of students enrolled
Page 61 of 1019 

on a Pass/Fail basis. At the end of the semester, a regular grade is submitted for the student enrolled under the P/F
option. Any grade of D- or above is converted in the Student Records System to a P, while an F will be recorded if a
student enrolled under this option fails the course. The P grade is not counted in the grade point average nor used
in the determination of honors. The grade of F earned under the Pass/Fail option is included in the calculation of the
grade point average.
 
Engineering: Students may elect to take a limited number of courses on a Pass/Fail basis. To enroll for a course on
a Pass/Fail basis, students must have completed at least two semesters at Vanderbilt, must have achieved at least
sophomore standing, and must not be on academic probation.
 
In addition, the following regulations apply to students enrolled in the School of Engineering:
1. No more than 9 hours graded Pass will be accepted toward the B.S. or B.E. degree, as designated by each
program's curriculum.
2. No more than two courses may be taken on a Pass/Fail basis in any one semester.
3. A minimum of 12 hours must be taken on a graded basis in any semester that a Pass/Fail course is taken. A
graduating senior who needs fewer than 12 hours to graduate may take courses on a Pass/Fail basis as long
as he or she takes the number of hours needed to graduate on a graded basis.
4. Students may elect grading on a Pass/Fail basis and may change from Pass/Fail to graded status until the
deadline date for withdrawing from a course that is published in the Academic Calendar.

Those electing the Pass/Fail option must meet all course requirements (e.g., reports, papers, examinations,
attendance, etc.) and are graded in the normal way. Instructors are not informed of the names of students enrolled
on a Pass/Fail basis. At the end of the semester, a regular grade is submitted for the student enrolled under the P/F
option. Any grade of D- or above is converted in the Student Records System to a P, while an F will be recorded if a
student enrolled under this option fails the course. The P grade is not counted in the grade point average or used in
the determination of honors. The grade of F earned under the Pass/Fail option is included in the calculation of the
grade point average.
 
Peabody: Students may elect to take some courses in which they can receive the grade P (Pass). This grade is
entered for the student enrolled under the P/F option who is awarded a grade of D- or higher. The grade P is neither
counted in the grade point average nor used in the determination of honors. A failing grade will appear on the
student record as F and will be counted in the student’s grade point average.
 
To be eligible for the P/F option, the student must have completed two regular semesters at Vanderbilt and must not
be on academic probation. No more than one course per semester may be taken on a P/F basis and no more than
three total during the undergraduate career. No more than one course from any Liberal Education Core area (e.g.,
communications, humanities) may be taken under this option.
 
Page 62 of 1019 

Note that neither courses taken for transfer credit (grade of “T”) nor courses that are only offered on a pass/fail
basis by the university (e.g., certain field experience courses) are counted against the number of courses that a
student may voluntarily elect to take on a pass/fail basis, either within or across semesters.
 
The P/F option does not apply to courses in the following categories:
1. Liberal Education Core Courses that have been specifically identified by the student’s primary major as
needing to be taken on a graded basis. 
2. For students with a single or double major, courses in the department(s) of the major(s) or other courses that
may be counted for the major(s);
3. For students with an interdisciplinary major, courses listed in the student’s plan of study;
4. For students planning an optional minor, courses in the department of the minor or those counting toward an
interdisciplinary minor.
Students taking a course on a P/F basis must be enrolled for at least 12 additional hours on a regularly graded basis.
If a student drops a course and falls below 12 graded hours, the P/F course is converted automatically to a regularly
graded basis.
 
Seniors who meet the above criteria and have permission to take fewer than 12 hours on a graded basis may take
one course on a P/F basis in one of their last two semesters (e.g., a semester in which an internship or student
teaching is not being taken). If the student does not graduate at the end of the senior year, the grade of P is
automatically converted to the grade actually earned. When a student wishes to complete a major or minor in a field
in which a grade of P has been received, the registrar converts this grade to the regular grade originally earned.
 
All P/F students are expected to meet normal course requirements (e.g., reports, papers, examinations, laboratory
attendance) and are graded in a normal way. At the end of the semester, students enrolled on a P/F basis are
awarded a regular grade. Any grade of D- or better is converted in the Student Records System to a P, while an F
grade remains as awarded. A student taking a course on a P/F basis must meet the course prerequisites as set forth
in this catalog.
 
Students may submit a Pass/Fail request form on or before the Pass/Fail declaration deadline. Students may change
from a P/F basis to a regularly graded basis until the last day to withdraw from classes in a given term. All Pass/Fail
deadlines are published in the Academic Calendar. The Pass/Fail form is available
online: peabody.vanderbilt.edu/admin-offices/oas/downloads.php.
Withdrawal (A&S, Blair, VUSE, PBDY)
Arts & Science: After the Change Period, and extending to the deadline published on the Undergraduate Academic
Calendar, a student may withdraw from a course with approval from the student’s adviser. Under certain conditions,
withdrawal may also require approval from an associate dean in 350 Buttrick Hall. During the same period students
may change their status from P/F to regularly graded or elect Pass/Fail status in a course.
 
These changes must be made with a Change of Course form, which is available online and which the student must
submit to the Dean’s Office of Undergraduate Education in Arts and Science. After the deadline, withdrawal is
possible only in the most extraordinary circumstances, such as illness or unusual personal or family problems, and in
all cases must be approved by the Administrative Committee. After the withdrawal deadline, change from P/F to
regularly graded status is not permitted.
 
Students who withdraw from a course after the change period receive the grade W (withdrawal). This grade is not
used in the computation of the grade point average or class rank. A student who defaults in a course without
dropping or withdrawing from it receives the grade F.
 
Blair: A student may withdraw from a course after the official Change Period and prior to the deadline for
Page 63 of 1019 

withdrawal published in the University Calendar, generally Friday of the week after mid-semester. A change of
course request form must be signed by the instructor, adviser, and associate dean and filed with the Office of
Academic Services. (Students from other schools of the university must file with their home school.) Withdrawals
after the published deadline result in an F. The grade W may be assigned by the associate dean to a student who
seeks to withdraw from a course or from school after the deadline for reasons such as extended illness or unusual
personal or family problems. No W grades are calculated in a student’s grade point average.
 
Engineering:  After the Change Period and extending to the deadline published on the Undergraduate Academic
Calendar, a student may withdraw from a course with approval of the student’s adviser. Under certain conditions,
withdrawal may also require approval from the senior associate dean. During the same period students may change
their status from P/F to regularly graded or vice versa. The W is recorded for any course from which a student
withdraws. A course in which a W is recorded is not used in figuring grade point averages.
 
Peabody: The symbol W (withdrawal) is assigned in lieu of a grade when a student formally withdraws from a class
before the published mid-semester deadline. After that point, withdrawal will result in an F. A student who
withdraws from school for reasons such as illness, unusual personal or family problems, and the like, may petition
the Dean’s Office for an authorized administrative withdrawal. If approved, the student will receive the grade W for
courses in progress. A student who withdraws from school without an authorized administrative withdrawal receives
the grade W or F depending upon the date of withdrawal. The grade W is not included in the calculation of the grade
point average.
Taking Courses for No Credit (A&S, Blair)
Arts & Science: Students may want to take elsewhere in the university courses that are not creditable toward the
bachelor’s degree. They may do so on a no-credit basis, attending classes, doing all the work of the course, and
receiving a grade that is recorded on the transcript with a notation that it does not count toward the degree.
 
No-credit courses count in computation of the student’s academic load and in computation of tuition, but not in
computation of the grade point average. They also do not count toward the attainment of class standing.
 
Blair: Students who wish to take courses on a no-credit basis must file with the Blair Office of Academic Services
before the end of the Change Period. Students must attend class and complete all course work. A grade is recorded
on the transcript with the notation "Grading Basis: No Credit Toward Current Degree," indicating that it does not
count toward the degree.
 
No-credit courses count in the computation of a student’s academic load and tuition, but not in the computation of
the grade point average.
Auditing (A&S, Blair, VUSE, PBDY)
Arts & Science: Regularly enrolled Arts and Science students who want to audit courses in any of the
undergraduate schools of the university must obtain the written consent of the instructor to attend the class but do
not register for the course for credit. Forms are available from the Dean’s Office of Undergraduate Education in each
school. No permanent record is kept of the audit. Regular students may audit one class each semester.
 
Blair: Regularly enrolled Blair students who want to audit courses in any of the undergraduate schools of the
university must complete the change of course request form and obtain the written consent of the instructor to
attend the class but do not register for the course for credit. No permanent record is kept of the audit. Regular
students may audit one class each semester.
 
Engineering: Regularly enrolled students in the School of Engineering who want to audit courses in any of the
undergraduate schools of the university must get the written consent of the instructor to attend the class and
Page 64 of 1019 

register to audit the course. Forms are available from the School of Engineering Office of Academic Services. No
permanent record is kept of the audit. Regular students may audit one class each semester.
 
Peabody: Regularly enrolled Peabody College students who want to audit courses in any of the undergraduate
schools of the university must obtain the written consent of the instructor to attend the class but do not register for
the course for credit. Forms are available online: peabody.vanderbilt.edu/admin-offices/oas/downloads.php. No
permanent record is kept of the audit. Regular students may audit one class each semester free of charge. In order
to audit a course, the student must also be enrolled in at least one additional graded credit hour in the same
semester.
Independent Study (A&S, Blair, PBDY)
Arts & Science: Independent study and directed study courses are intended primarily for students in their junior
and senior years. Students may not take an independent study or directed study course that duplicates a regular
course being offered in the same semester. Juniors or seniors who wish to take independent study or directed study
courses must use the following procedure:
1. Students may initiate the independent study enrollment process in YES by clicking on the Individual Study link
on the student landing page.
2. Students must be registered in the independent study before the end of the change period.
Blair: Students must obtain permission to enroll in Independent Study from the instructor of their choice prior to
registration. Independent Study authorization forms are available at blair.vanderbilt.edu/academics. The instructor’s
signature on the authorization form indicates a willingness to supervise the Independent Study project. A contract or
study plan, approved by the instructor in consultation with the appropriate department chair and the associate
dean, must be submitted to the Blair Office of Academic Services by the tenth calendar day after classes begin. If no
plan is submitted, the student will be dropped from Independent Study. An Independent Study project should result
in a substantial written report, paper, or lecture/recital. The report, recording, or some physical manifestation of the
project should be retained by the instructor. Independent Study projects proposed by students for cross-school
registration should be approved through the mechanisms of both schools. Consult associate deans from both
schools for guidance.
 
A student may register for a maximum of 3 hours in Independent Study in a semester. A student may count a total
of 6 hours in Independent Study toward the degree. A faculty member may supervise no more than four students
per semester in Independent Study projects.
 
Independent Study cannot substitute for courses which are part of the curriculum.
 
Peabody: Independent study courses, ranging from zero to three hours of credit, are listed in the Schedule of
Courses and are intended for students in their junior and senior years. Students wanting to undertake an
independent study must follow these guidelines:
1. Students must be in academic “good standing” (may not be on probation or Leave of Absence).
2. Students must arrange the independent study with a Vanderbilt full time faculty member who has agreed to
supervise and grade this course.
3. Students may enroll for up to 3 hours of independent study in one semester.
4. Students must make a study plan detailing the nature of the project and the amount of credit. The Individual
Learning/Directed Study contract must be approved by the instructor and the department chair (or the chair’s
designee) by the last day of the change period.
5. Registration for the course occurs when the completed Individual Learning/Directed Study contract is
submitted to the Peabody Office of Academic Services. Registration for an independent study will not be
allowed after the change period has ended.
Students may not repeat independent study courses for grade replacement.
Minimum Graded Credit Hours (A&S)
Arts & Science: A course may not be dropped without authorization of the Administrative Committee or an
Page 65 of 1019 

associate dean if the student is left with a course load of fewer than 12 credit hours on a regularly graded basis.
Duplication of Course Content (A&S, PBDY)
Arts & Science: It is the responsibility of the individual student to avoid duplication in whole or in part of the
content of any course counting toward the degree. Such duplication may result in the withdrawal of credit.
 
Peabody: It is the responsibility of the individual student to avoid duplication in whole or in part of the content of
any courses offered toward the degree. Such duplication may result in the withdrawal of credit. This policy also
applies to Advanced Placement credit.
 
Certain courses (e.g., ensemble, performance instruction, special topics, and directed study) are designated as
repeatable as they contain evolving or iteratively new content. These courses may be taken multiple times for
credit. If a course can be repeated, the number of credits allowable per semester should not exceed 3 credit hours
without permission.
Repeated Courses (A&S, Blair, VUSE, PBDY)
Arts & Science: Most courses offered in the College of Arts and Science may be repeated. If a course was failed the
last time it was taken, credit is awarded when the course is repeated with a passing grade. If a course was
previously passed, no new credit is earned. If a course previously passed is repeated and failed, credit originally
earned for it is lost. In any case all grades earned are shown on the transcript. Under conditions explained below, the
most recent grade in a course replaces the previous grade in determining credit, in computing the grade point
average, and in verifying the completion of degree requirements and progress toward the degree.
 
The policy of grade replacement applies when all of the conditions below are met.
1. Failed courses may be repeated until passed; passed courses may be repeated only once. 
2. Exactly the same course (same department and course number) is completed. A repeated First-Year Writing
Seminar must have the same department and section number but cannot be repeated after completion of the
second semester in residence.
3. The course is repeated on a regularly graded basis. This limitation applies even if the course was originally
taken on a P/F basis.
4. The course is not one in independent study or directed study.
5. A non-W course is taken as repeat credit for a Writing version of the same course that was previously passed.
The student loses credit for the writing requirement.
6. A W course is taken as repeat credit for a non-Writing version of the same course that was previously passed.
The student earns credit for the writing requirement.
7. Certain courses (e.g., ensemble, performance instruction, and independent study) are designated as
repeatable as they contain evolving or iteratively new content. These courses may be taken multiple times
for credit. If a course can be repeated, the number of credit hours allowable per semester will be included in
the course description.
In some instances, enrollment in a course similar to one already completed but with a different course number will
result in the award of no credit for the second course and will have no effect on the grade point average. These are
designated in the departmental course listings.
 
Courses taken in the College of Arts and Science may not be repeated elsewhere for grade replacement.
 
Students are cautioned that while repeating for grade replacement a course previously passed may improve their
cumulative grade point average, it may also lead to a problem in meeting minimum credit hours requirements for
class standing because no new credit is earned.
 
Blair: Certain courses, notably performing ensembles and variable credit performance instruction, may be taken
Page 66 of 1019 

more than once for credit. Otherwise, students may repeat any course to replace a grade, with no additional credit
hours earned, subject to the following conditions:
Courses taken at Vanderbilt may not be repeated elsewhere. A grade may not be replaced by a grade of
“Pass.”
A grade of W or I cannot replace a letter grade.
Only the most recent grade is calculated in the grade point average, but all grades show on the transcript.
Engineering: Courses in which a student has earned a grade lower than B– may be repeated under certain
conditions. A course in which the student earned a grade between D– and C+, inclusive, may be repeated only once.
A course may be repeated only on a graded basis, even if the course was originally taken Pass/Fail. Courses taken
Pass/Fail in which the student earned a Pass may not be repeated. A course cannot be repeated through credit by
examination.
 
Students should note that repeating a course may improve the grade point average, but it may also lead to
problems in meeting minimum hour requirements for class standing and progress toward a degree. Repeating a
course does not increase the number of hours used in calculation of the grade point average. All grades earned will
be shown on the transcript, but only the latest grade will be used for computation of grade point averages.
 
Peabody: If a course is repeated, only the last grade and credit hours earned will be used to calculate the grade
point average and be creditable toward graduation. However, the original grade will appear on the transcript.
Certain courses (e.g., special topics courses, directed study courses; see duplicate content section, below) may be
repeated for credit when there is no duplication of content. Such courses may be repeated to replace a grade only
when the content of the original and repeated courses is the same. Courses must be repeated in a graded status.
This policy also applies to Advanced Placement credit. Courses taken at Vanderbilt may not be repeated elsewhere
for grade replacement, nor may courses taken elsewhere be repeated at Vanderbilt for grade replacement.
Undergraduate Enrollment in Graduate School Courses (A&S, Blair, VUSE, PBDY)
Arts & Science: In the 4-digit course numbering system some courses may enroll undergraduate and graduate
students simultaneously. Typically, there is a 3000- or 4000-level course for undergraduates and a matching 5000-
level course for graduate students. Undergraduate students may enroll in the 3000- or 4000-level course of these
pairs without special approval.
 
A qualified Vanderbilt University senior undergraduate may enroll in courses approved for graduate credit (those
numbered 5000 and higher) and receive credit that, upon the student’s admission to the Vanderbilt Graduate
School, may be applicable toward a graduate degree. Vanderbilt cannot guarantee that another graduate school will
grant credit for such courses. The principles governing this option are as follows:
1. Work taken under this option is limited to those courses approved for graduate credit (those numbered 5000
and higher) and listed as such in the Graduate School catalog, excluding thesis and dissertation research
courses and similar individual research and readings courses. Courses approved for professional credit (i.e.,
many courses in the Divinity School, Law School, School of Medicine, School of Nursing, and Owen Graduate
School of Management) may not be taken as part of this option.
2. The student must, at the time of registration, have a 3.00 average in all prior work to be counted toward the
bachelor’s degree, or a 3.00 average in all prior work to be counted toward the undergraduate major, or a
3.00 average in the preceding two semesters.
3. The total course load, including both graduate and undergraduate courses, must not exceed 15 credit hours in
any semester.
4. No undergraduate student may enroll in more than one graduate course in any semester.
5. A registration form for undergraduate Arts and Science students wishing to exercise this option is available in
the Dean’s Office of Undergraduate Education. The interested student must use this form to obtain the
written approval of the following:
1. the academic adviser,
2. the instructor of the course,
3. and the director of graduate studies of the department or program.
Engineering: A qualified Vanderbilt junior or senior may enroll in courses approved for graduate credit by the
graduate faculty. Credit from such courses may be applied to undergraduate degree requirements or, upon the
student’s admission to the Vanderbilt University Graduate School, toward a graduate degree. Vanderbilt cannot
Page 67 of 1019 

guarantee that another graduate school will grant credit for such courses. The principles governing this option are
as follows:
1. Work taken under this option is limited to courses numbered 5000 and above and listed in the catalog of the
Graduate School, excluding thesis and dissertation research courses and similar individual research and
reading courses.
2. The student must, at the time of registration, have a 3.500 grade point average in the preceding two
semesters.
3. The total course load, graduate and undergraduate courses, must not exceed 18 hours in that semester.
4. The student must obtain the written approval of their academic adviser and the instructor of the course on a
form available in the Office of Academic Services.
5. Permission for Vanderbilt undergraduates to enroll in graduate courses does not constitute a commitment on
the part of any program to accept the student as a graduate student in the future.
6. An undergraduate student exercising this option will be treated as a graduate student with regard to class
requirements and grading standards.
Peabody: All students wishing to take 5000–8000-level courses for either undergraduate or graduate credit must
obtain the written approval of their academic advisers, the instructor of the course, and the Office of Academic
Services. Some courses are designed to enroll both undergraduate and graduate/professional students in the same
class section. Such courses will typically have two course numbers, one in the graduate range (5000–8000) and one
in the undergraduate range (usually either 3000– or 4000–level). Unless they wish to take the course for post-
baccalaureate credit, undergraduates must register for the course using the undergraduate course number and may
do so without any special permission.
Undergraduates wishing to receive approval for graduate credit in 5000–8000-level courses also see Reserving
Credit for Graduate School (A&S, PBDY).
Reserving Credit for Graduate School (A&S, PBDY)
Arts & Science:
1. Arts and Science students who are interested in reserving the credit earned in a graduate course (those
numbered 5000 and higher) should consult with the Graduate School before attempting to register for
graduate courses under this option.
2. The work must be in excess of that required for the bachelor’s degree. 
3. All of the above criteria apply under this option. 
4. Students must declare their intention to reserve this credit on the registration form.
5. Permission for Vanderbilt undergraduates to enroll in graduate courses does not constitute a commitment on
the part of any department to accept the student as a graduate student in the future.
6. An undergraduate student exercising this option is treated as a graduate student with regard to class
requirements and grading standards.
Peabody: A qualified Vanderbilt University senior undergraduate may enroll in courses approved for post-
baccalaureate credit and receive credit which, upon the student’s admission into a Peabody College professional
program, may be applicable toward the professional degree. The principles governing this option are as follows:
1. Work taken under this option is limited to those 5000–8000-level courses approved for post-baccalaureate
credit, excluding thesis and dissertation research courses and similar individual research and readings
courses.
2. Such work must be in excess of that required for the bachelor’s degree.
3. At the time of registration, the student must have a B average in all prior work to be counted toward the
bachelor’s degree, or a B average in all prior work to be counted toward the undergraduate major, or
a B average in the preceding two semesters.
4. Undergraduate students wishing to count for post-baccalaureate credit courses taken under this option must
consult the instructor of each course and must, at the time of registration, declare their intention on a form
available at the Office of Academic Services.
5. The student’s total course load (graduate plus undergraduate courses) must not exceed 15 hours during any
semester in which graduate credit is pursued.
6. Permission for Vanderbilt undergraduates to enroll in post-baccalaureate courses does not constitute a
commitment on the part of any department to accept the student in the future. Courses taken under this
option are subject to departmental approval before they may be included on post-baccalaureate programs of
study.
7. An undergraduate student exercising this option will be treated as a post-baccalaureate student with regard
to class requirements and grading standards.

physically present at Vanderbilt and enrolled in Vanderbilt University classes offered on campus, or (b) enrolled in
at least 12 credit hours in an approved Vanderbilt study abroad program. During these four or more semesters, the
student must have completed at least 60 semester hours of an approved curriculum in one of the degree programs.
 
Peabody: Students must complete a minimum of 60 hours in residence at Vanderbilt including the final two
semesters.
Advanced Placement (Blair)
Blair: Advanced Placement with Credit. Advanced placement with credit is granted in a number of areas (see the
chapter on Admission).
Page 69 of 1019 

 
Advanced Placement without Credit. Students may be admitted to advanced music courses on the basis of
placement tests at Blair, but no credit is awarded for music courses exempted.
Credit Hour Definition (Blair, VUSE, PBDY)
Blair/Engineering/Peabody: Credit hours are semester hours; e.g., a three-hour course carries credit of three
semester hours. One semester credit hour represents at least three hours of academic work per week, on average,
for one semester. Academic work includes, but is not necessarily limited to, lectures, laboratory work, homework,
research, class readings, independent study, internships, practica, studio work, recitals, practicing, rehearsing, and
recitations. Some Vanderbilt courses may have requirements which exceed this definition. Certain courses (e.g.,
dissertation research, ensemble, performance instruction, and independent study) are designated as repeatable as
they contain evolving or iteratively new content. These courses may be taken multiple times for credit. If a course
can be repeated, the number of credits allowable per semester will be included in the course description.
Grading System (A&S, Blair, VUSE, PBDY)
Arts & Science:
 
A: excellent
   B: good
   C: satisfactory
   D: minimum pass work
   F: failure
 
Under certain circumstances the following grades may be awarded:
 
   W: withdrawal
   P: (see P/F Course Provision)
   M: absent from final examination
   I: incomplete in some requirement other than final examination
   IP: first semester grade for two-semester Honors sequence
 
Plus and minus modifiers may be associated with letter grades A through D as shown in the table below. Grade point
averages are calculated using indicated grade point values.
 
Blair:
 
A:           excellent
B:           good
C:           satisfactory
D:           minimum pass work
F:            failure
Page 70 of 1019 

 
Under certain circumstances the following grades may be awarded (see explanations below):
 
Pass:       D– or above
W:           withdrawal
M:           missed final examination (prior approval needed; see below)
I:             incomplete in some requirement other than final examination (see below)
 
Plus and minus modifiers may be associated with letter grades A through D as shown in the table below. Grade point
averages are calculated using indicated grade point values.
 
Engineering:
 
Work is graded by letter. A, B, C, and D are considered passing grades. The grade F signifies failure. A student who
withdraws from a course before the date given in the Academic Calendar is given the grade W. A student may not
withdraw from a course after that date.
 
Peabody:
Peabody College undergraduate students are on a four-point grading system. All work is graded by letters,
interpreted as follows:
 
A:      excellent
B:      good
C:      satisfactory
D:      minimum pass work
F:       failure
 
Under certain circumstances the following grades may be awarded:
 
W:      withdrawal
P:       pass (see Pass/D/Fail course provision)
M:      missed final examination
I:       incomplete in some requirement other than final examination
 
Plus and minus modifiers may be associated with the letters A through D as shown in the table below. Grade point
averages are calculated using indicated grade point values.
Grade Reports (A&S, Blair, VUSE)
Arts & Science: Students have access to their grade reports on the Academic Record in YES. Notifications are sent
Page 71 of 1019 

to students in their last two semesters, showing total credit hours, grade point average, and degree requirements
still to be met. Students should examine their Degree Audit carefully and discuss it with their advisers. Any errors
should be reported immediately to the Dean’s Office of Undergraduate Education. A grade reported and recorded in
the Office of the University Registrar may be changed only upon request of the instructor with the approval of the
Administrative Committee. The committee will approve such a change only on certification that the original report
was in error.
 
Blair: Grade reports and faculty critiques of performance examinations will be provided to students as soon as
possible at the end of each semester. Grades are available online in the Academic Record, which is housed within
YES (Your Enrollment Services) at yes.vanderbilt.edu. Occasionally, student academic information may be shared
with appropriate faculty committees for purposes of promotion and tenure review.
 
A grade reported and recorded in the Office of the University Registrar may be changed only upon written request of
the instructor, on certification that the original report was in error, with approval of the associate dean.
 
Engineering: A grade report will be available to the student on Academic Record in YES as soon as possible after
the conclusion of each semester. This report will give the total hours and grade points earned during the semester,
as well as the cumulative hours and grade points earned through that semester. Students should examine these
reports carefully and discuss them with their faculty advisers. Any errors should be reported immediately to the
Office of Academic Services of the School of Engineering.
 
A grade reported and recorded in the Office of the University Registrar may be changed only upon written request of
the instructor and with approval of the Administrative Committee. The committee will approve such a change only
on certification that the original report was in error.
Grade Point Average (A&S, Blair, VUSE, PBDY)
Arts & Science: A student’s grade point average is obtained by dividing the quality points earned by the credit
hours for which the student has registered, excluding courses taken for no credit, those from which the student has
officially withdrawn (see Withdrawal Period under Registration above), and those completed with the grade P.
 
In no case is the grade point average affected by transfer credit. No course at another institution in which a grade
below C– was received, or which was taken on a Pass/Fail basis, is credited toward the degrees awarded by the
College of Arts and Science.
 
Blair: A student’s grade point average is obtained by dividing the total grade points earned by the number of hours
for which the student registered, excluding courses audited or taken for no credit, those from which the student has
withdrawn or for which an incomplete grade (I or M) has been authorized, and those with the grade Pass.
 
Engineering: A student’s grade point average is obtained by dividing the total grade points earned by the number
of hours for which the student registered, excluding courses taken for no credit, those from which the student has
withdrawn, those with the temporary grade of I or M, those taken in a study abroad program, and those that are
completed with the grade Pass.
 
Peabody: A student’s grade point average is obtained by dividing the grade points earned by the hours for which
the student has registered, excluding courses taken for no credit, those from which the student has withdrawn, and
those that are completed with the grade P.

F: Failure (A&S, VUSE)
Arts & Science: The grade F indicates failure. All F’s are counted in the computation of grade point averages,
except when a course is repeated and is subsequently passed. In this case the latest grade is used for computation
of the grade point average (but the grade originally earned is not removed from the transcript). A course in which
the grade F is received must be repeated as a regular course if credit is to be given. It may not be repeated as a
course in independent or directed study, under the procedures for credit by examination, or on a P/F basis.
 
Engineering: A subject in which the grade F is received must be taken again in class before credit is given. A
student who deserts a course without following the correct procedure for withdrawing from it will receive an F in the
course.

Grade Appeals (PBDY)
Peabody: A student who believes they have received an inappropriate final grade in a class can appeal that grade
if they believe the grade is inappropriate for at least one of the following reasons:
1. The student is held to different standards than other students in the course.
2. The instructor in determining the final grade applied standards that departed from those outlined in the
course syllabus.
3. The student believes that there is a clerical error in the calculation or reporting of the grade.
4. The instructor did not adequately consider the student’s needs for officially sanctioned and communicated
accommodations.
Ultimately, the grade can be appealed following the academic appeals process outlined for more general academic
matters, directly above. However, several steps to attempt to resolve the grade should be taken, in turn, before an
appeal is submitted to the Undergraduate Administrative Committee (UAC).
 
First, students and instructors are encouraged to resolve grade disputes informally. If an informal process fails, the
student may formally appeal a final course grade by contacting the instructor in writing within ten (10) business
days after the start of the following semester. The student’s written appeal must include the grounds for the appeal
(see conditions 1 through 4 listed above), the change in grade that is being requested, and evidence to support the
student’s case for a grade change. The instructor must inform the student of his/her decision in writing.
 
Second, if the student does not feel the matter has been resolved satisfactorily with the instructor, the student may
petition the director of undergraduate studies in the department where the course is housed. The petition for
reviewing the appeal must include the original written appeal, the instructor’s written response, and the reason why
the student is dissatisfied with the instructor’s decision. The DUS will review the materials and assess the merits of
the case. If the DUS finds no basis for the grievance, the petition will be dismissed and the student will be notified in
writing. If the DUS determines that the grievance has merit, the DUS will work with the parties to seek a resolution. If
the DUS is the course instructor, the student may directly petition the department chair in which the course is
housed.
 
Third, if the case is dismissed by the DUS, and the student does not agree with the grounds for the decision, the
student may petition the chair of the department where the course is housed. The student is responsible for
providing the department chair with relevant case documentation, including the original written appeal, the written
responses of both the instructor and the DUS, and an explanation as to why the student is dissatisfied with the DUS’s
decision to dismiss the case. The department chair will decide the merits of the case and provide written
documentation to all parties as to the decision. If the case is determined to have merit, the department chair will
seek a resolution among the parties involved, including the student, the instructor, and the DUS. If the department
chair is the course instructor, the student may appeal the DUS’s decision directly to the Undergraduate
Administrative Committee using the more general academic appeals process outlined in the previous Appeals
section.
 
Fourth, if the case is dismissed by the department chair and the student does not agree with the grounds for the
decision, the student may appeal the department chair’s decision to the Undergraduate Administrative Committee
using the more general academic appeals process outlined in the previous Appeals section.
Mid-Semester Progress Reports (A&S)
Arts & Science: At the end of the seventh week of each semester, instructors assess the progress of all students in
their classes and report those whose work at that point is deficient or whose work is being harmed by excessive
absences. Grades to be reported are C–, D+, D, D–, F, and I (for incomplete, meaning that some work due by that
point has not been submitted). Instructors may combine with one of these grades or assign separately a notation of
excessive absences from a class. Reports of these deficiencies are posted in the Academic Record application in
YES. Grades given at mid-semester do not become part of the permanent record but are intended to warn students
about performance judged unsatisfactory.
Deficiency Notices (Blair)
Page 74 of 1019 

Blair: During the week after mid-semester, the Office of the University Registrar posts deficiency notices for
students whose mid-semester grade in any course is a C– or below or whose work is incomplete (I). (Deficiency
notices are found in the Academic Detail in YES at yes.vanderbilt.edu.) Deficiencies are issued as a matter of
information and warning. Deficiencies do not show on transcripts, but information is sent to the faculty advisers and
may be sent to parents of those students who have submitted a FERPA Release form indicating permission to
release academic information to specific individuals.
 
A student who receives a deficiency notice is required to meet with the faculty adviser before the deadline for
withdrawal at the end of the week. A student with deficiencies in two or more courses or any senior who receives a
deficiency notice is also required to meet with the associate dean before the deadline for withdrawal (usually Friday
of the week after mid-semester).
Temporary Grades (A&S, Blair, VUSE, PBDY)
Arts & Science, Blair, Engineering, Peabody: Temporary grades are placeholders that are assigned under
defined circumstances and are not replacements for failing grades. Missing work must be completed by the deadline
specified by the instructor (usually before the end of the second week of classes in the next regular term but no
later than the end of the following semester) after which the permanent grade is recorded (either the newly
assigned or default grade). The default grade is calculated by assigning zero points for work not submitted.
Temporary grades are not calculated in the GPA, but a student who receives a temporary grade is ineligible for the
Dean's List. An undergraduate student cannot graduate with any temporary grades on their record.
The following temporary grades are available
 
I: Incomplete
 
To be assigned only if the following conditions apply:
1. An extenuating circumstance has emerged after the course withdrawal deadline
2. The student is up to date on all work prior to the extenuating circumstance
3. The student successfully completed at least 60% of the assigned work throughout the semester
4. The student requests the incomplete before the end of classes
5. The student has been attending a significant majority of the classes
 M: Missed Final Examination or Final Evaluation
 
To be assigned only if the following conditions apply:
1. The student misses only the final examination or final evaluation and promptly informs the instructor as to
the extenuating circumstances for missing the final exam/evaluation. In the absence of prompt notification of
extenuating circumstances, a grade of zero for the final exam/evaluation is recorded.
2. The student could pass the course if the final examination is successfully completed. (The grade of F is given
if the student could not pass the course even with the final examination.)
Transfer Credit (A&S, Blair, VUSE, PBDY)
Arts & Science: It is the student’s responsibility to provide all of the information required by the Office of the
University Registrar to assess the program for which transfer of credit is requested. Work presented for transfer
must be from a regionally accredited college and is subject to evaluation in light of the degree requirements of the
College of Arts and Science. Credit will not be awarded for independent study, physical education, or dance
performance courses.
 
Work transferred to Vanderbilt from another institution will not carry with it a grade point average. No course in
which a grade below C– was received, or which was taken on a Pass/Fail basis, will be credited toward a degree
offered by the College of Arts and Science. The question of credit in the College of Arts and Science for previous
Page 75 of 1019 

work done at another institution must be settled in advance of the student’s first registration.
 
Transfer students must spend at least four full semesters, including the last two semesters, enrolled in the College
of Arts and Science. They must earn at least 60 credit hours and complete at least one writing course in fulfillment
of the writing requirement while so enrolled.
 
Blair: Transfer courses are often taken as free electives, but they may also earn liberal arts core credit. They may
not fulfill the music core requirements, count as part of the last 30 hours of residence, serve as repeat credit, or be
taken on a Pass/Fail basis. Work transferred from another institution will not carry with it a grade point average. No
course in which a grade below C– was received will be credited toward the B.Mus. or B.Mus.Arts. It is the student’s
responsibility to provide all of the information required by the Office of the University Registrar to assess the
program for which transfer of credit is requested. Work presented for transfer must be from a regionally accredited
college or university. Information on the evaluation process and policies is available
at registrar.vanderbilt.edu/transfer-credit.
 
Summer studies. Students enrolled at Blair may receive transfer credit for summer courses taken at another
regionally accredited two-year or four-year college or university. This may include work at festivals or camps, if
offered through a regionally accredited institution. To qualify for summer credit, a student must be in good standing,
consult the Office of Academic Services, and submit courses for evaluation through the Transfer Credit portal in YES.
A detailed course syllabus is required in order for a course to be evaluated. Deadline for pre- approval is April 1.
 
Semester work at another institution. Students wanting to receive transfer credit for a semester of work at another
regionally accredited institution must receive approval in advance from the associate dean. To qualify for such
credit, the student must be in good standing and must present a plan that makes clear the educational rationale for
such work, the ways in which it supplements the Vanderbilt curriculum, and the equivalence of standards to those at
Vanderbilt. Approval of the overall plan must be followed by approval of specific courses by the associate dean and
submission of courses through the transfer credit evaluation process in YES. A detailed course syllabus is required in
order for a course to be evaluated. Students enrolled full time (i.e., carrying at least 12 credit hours) during a regular
(fall or spring) semester are assumed to be engaged in full-time study at Vanderbilt. Such students are not
permitted to take additional course work elsewhere, for transfer credit, during the semester. This includes online  
courses as well as courses offered by nearby institutions.
 
Engineering: Work that a student contemplates taking at a college or university other than Vanderbilt after
matriculating to VU is treated as transfer work and must be approved in advance in writing through the YES Transfer
Credit application. The institution must have appropriate regional accreditation. It is the student’s responsibility to
provide all information needed for an assessment of the program and course(s) for which transfer credit is
requested. Students must upload a detailed syllabus, which then must be approved by the Office of the University
Registrar, the relevant Vanderbilt University department, and the School of Engineering Dean’s Office. Work
transferred to Vanderbilt from another institution will not be included in the Vanderbilt grade point average. No
transfer credit course in which a grade below C- was earned or that was taken after the start of the penultimate
Vanderbilt semester will be credited toward a degree offered by the School of Engineering. A course a student has
taken at Vanderbilt may not be repeated in another institution to obtain a higher grade or to obtain credit. Students
who have been dismissed from Vanderbilt and subsequently return to Vanderbilt are not eligible to receive transfer
credit for any classes taken during the period of dismissal. Students cannot take courses for transfer credit at or
through another institution while simultaneously enrolled in a semester at Vanderbilt unless authorized in advance
by the School’s Administrative Committee.
 
Peabody: Students who transfer from another institution must have a final transcript sent directly to the
Undergraduate Admissions Office, Vanderbilt University. Upon acceptance, students will be asked to submit course
descriptions and syllabi for all proposed transfer credit. Upon acceptance, courses will be evaluated by Vanderbilt to
determine which courses will transfer and which requirements (e.g., Liberal Education Core, professional core) are
met by the transfer courses. No course for which a student received the grade D+ or lower will transfer. Course
work transferred to Vanderbilt from another institution will not carry with it a grade point average.
Page 76 of 1019 

 
Transfer students must complete at least 60 hours of work at Vanderbilt. Two of the four semesters in residence
must be the last two semesters of the student’s degree program.
 
Peabody students who wish to take course work during the summer, or during an academic-year semester, at a
regionally accredited two-year or four-year college or university and transfer up to 12 hours to Vanderbilt must be in
good standing with at least a C average. Prior approval must be granted for all courses to be taken elsewhere. If the
courses are to be taken during the academic year, the student must take a personal leave explicitly approved for
this purpose by the Peabody Dean’s Office. Students on leave for other reasons (e.g., medical or other personal
reasons) cannot take course work elsewhere for transfer credit without prior permission. Course work transferred to
Vanderbilt from another institution will not carry with it a grade point average.
 
Requests to participate in non-Vanderbilt-approved overseas programs for transfer credit will be approved only
under exceptional circumstances in which the proposed program represents a truly unique and unusual educational
opportunity. To apply for approval, the student should complete the transfer of credit application and apply for a
leave of absence for the relevant semester. The student must be in good standing with at least a 2.700 grade point
average as of the date of application, and approval must be granted in advance of the study overseas. Petitions for
leaves of this type must be filed at least one month before the close of the preceding semester, and final approval
of such petitions always rests with the dean’s office. It should be noted, however, that if a program has been
approved by Vanderbilt, students must enroll in the program via the Global Education Office. In no case, after
matriculating at Vanderbilt, may a student apply to participate in an approved program for transfer credit through a
different university, or through an external agency, and then seek to transfer that credit into Vanderbilt.
 
Students enrolled full time (i.e., carrying at least 12 credit hours) during a regular (fall or spring) semester are
assumed to be engaged in full-time study at Vanderbilt. Such students are not permitted to take additional course
work elsewhere, for transfer credit, during the semester. This includes online courses, as well as courses offered by
nearby institutions.
Summer or Winter Work at Another Institution (A&S)
Arts & Science: Students enrolled in the College of Arts and Science may receive transfer credit for a maximum of
two courses taken during summer or winter at a regionally-accredited institution. To qualify for such credit, the
student must be in good academic standing and must obtain prior authorization from the appropriate department
by submitting courses through the Transfer Credit Submission application in YES. A detailed course syllabus is
required in order for a course to be evaluated. Such courses cannot fulfill AXLE requirements, count as part of the
last 30 credit hours in residence, duplicate a course taken previously, or be taken on a Pass/Fail or similar basis.
Students cannot transfer credit for summer or winter work from outside of the country of their permanent home
address.
Credit by Examination (A&S, Blair, VUSE, PBDY)
Arts & Science: In certain circumstances, students may be awarded course credit by departmental examination.
(This procedure is distinct from the award of credit through the College Board Advanced Placement Tests taken prior
to the student’s first enrollment.)
 
Students who wish to earn credit by departmental examination should consult the Dean’s Office of Undergraduate
Education in Arts and Science concerning procedures. To be eligible, students must be carrying a minimum of 12
credit hours and be in good standing.
 
Students must obtain the approval of the chair of the department that is to give the examination and the instructor
designated by the chair. Students may earn up to 18 hours of credit by any combination of credit through advanced
placement examinations and credit by departmental examination. Students may earn up to 8 hours of credit by
examination in any one department. Students may attempt to obtain credit by examination no more than twice in
one semester, no more than once in one course in one semester, and no more than twice in one course. Students
may not repeat a course for grade replacement under the credit by examination procedures. Credits earned by
Page 77 of 1019 

credit by examination may not be counted toward AXLE.
 
Credit hours and grade are awarded on the basis of the grade earned on the examination, subject to the policy of
the department awarding credit. Students have the option of refusing to accept the credit hours and grade after
learning the results of the examination.
 
Students enrolled for at least 12 credit hours are not charged extra tuition for hours earned through credit by
examination, so long as the amount of credit falls within the allowable limits of an 18-hour tuition load, including no-
credit courses and courses dropped after the Change Period. Students in this category must pay a $50 fee for the
cost of constructing, administering, and grading the examination. Since this cost has already been incurred,
students who refuse the credit hours and grade are charged the $50 fee nevertheless.
 
Full-time students with a tuition load exceeding 18 credit hours and students taking fewer than 12 credit hours pay
tuition at the regular rate with no additional fee.
 
Blair: In certain circumstances, students may be awarded course credit (a maximum of 8 hours) by departmental
examination. This procedure is distinct from the awarding of credit through the College Board Advanced Placement
Tests or the International Baccalaureate. Students apply for credit by examination through the Blair Office of
Academic Services.
 
To earn credit by departmental examination, students must be enrolled for at least 12 hours, be in good standing,
be recommended by their advisers, and have the approval of the appropriate department. In addition, students
must seek prior approval of their study plan through the associate dean’s office. Students may attempt to earn
credit by examination in no more than two courses in one semester, only once in any course in one semester, and
no more than twice in the same course.
 
Credit hours and grade are awarded on the basis of the grade earned on the examination, subject to the policy of
the department awarding credit. Students have the option of refusing to accept the credit hours and grade after
learning the results of the examination.
 
Students enrolled for at least 12 hours are not charged extra tuition for hours earned through credit by examination,
so long as the amount of credit falls within the allowable limits of an 18-hour tuition load, including no-credit courses
and courses dropped after the change period. Students in this category must pay a $50 fee for the cost of
constructing, administering, and grading the examination. Since this cost has already been incurred, students who
refuse the credit hours and grade are charged the $50 fee nevertheless. Full-time students with a tuition load
exceeding 18 hours and students taking fewer than 12 hours pay tuition at the regular rate, per credit hour, with no
additional fee.
 
Engineering: In certain circumstances students may be awarded course credit by departmental examination. (This
procedure is distinct from the award of credit through the College Board Advanced Placement or International
Baccalaureate Examinations, taken prior to a student’s first enrollment at Vanderbilt or another college.)
 
Students who want to earn credit by departmental examination should consult the associate dean concerning
procedures. To be eligible, students must be in good standing.
 
Students must obtain the approval of the chair of the department that is to give the examination and of the
instructor designated by the chair. Students may earn up to 8 hours of credit by examination in any one
department, although this limitation might be raised on approval of the Administrative Committee. Students may
Page 78 of 1019 

attempt to obtain credit by examination no more than twice in one semester, no more than once in one course in
one semester, and no more than twice in one course.
 
Credit hours and grade are awarded on the basis of the grade earned on the examination, subject to the policy of
the department awarding credit. Students have the option of refusing to accept the credit hours and grade after
learning the results of the examination.
 
Students enrolled for at least 12 hours are not charged tuition for hours for which credit by examination is awarded,
so long as the amount of credit falls within the allowable limits of an 18-hour tuition load, including no- credit courses
dropped after the change period of registration. Students in this category must pay a fee of $50 for the cost of
administering the examination.
 
Peabody: In certain circumstances students may be awarded course credit by departmental examination. (This
procedure is distinct from the award of credit through the College Board Advanced Placement Tests taken prior to a
student’s first enrollment.). Students wanting to earn credit by departmental examination should consult the
Peabody Office of Academic Services concerning procedures. To be eligible, students must be carrying a minimum
of 12 hours and be in good standing.
 
Students must obtain the approval of the chair of the department that is to give the examination and the instructor
designated by the chair. Students may earn up to 8 hours of credit by examination in any one department. Students
may attempt to obtain credit by examination no more than twice in one semester and no more than twice in one
course. Students may not repeat a course for grade replacement under the credit by examination procedures.
 
Credit hours and grade are awarded on the basis of the grade earned on the examination, subject to the policy of
the department awarding credit. Students have the option of refusing to accept the credit hours and grade after
learning the results of the examination.
 
Students enrolled for at least 12 hours are not charged extra tuition for hours earned through credit by examination,
so long as the amount of credit falls within the allowable limits of an 18-hour tuition load, including no- credit courses
and courses dropped after the change period. Students in this category must pay a $50 fee for the cost of
constructing, administering, and grading the examination. Since this cost has already been incurred, students who
refuse the credit hours and grade are charged the $50 fee nevertheless.
 
Full-time students with a tuition load exceeding 18 hours and students taking fewer than 12 hours pay tuition at the
hourly tuition rate.

Requirements for the degree (VUSE)
Engineering: Engineering: Candidates for a degree must have completed satisfactorily all curriculum requirements,
have passed all prescribed examinations, and be free of indebtedness to the university. If graduation requirements
change during the time students are in school, they may elect to be bound by the requirements published in the
catalog in any year during their undergraduate academic career at Vanderbilt.
Grade Point Average Requirements (VUSE)
Engineering: To be eligible for graduation, a student must have successfully completed all degree requirements
and shall have earned a minimum grade point average of 2.000 in (a) all courses taken, (b) courses taken within the
School of Engineering, and (c) department courses of each major.
Graduation Requirements (Blair, VUSE, PBDY)
Blair: Candidates for degrees must have completed 126 hours and all curriculum requirements, have passed all
prescribed examinations, and be free of indebtedness to the university.
 
Exceptions to stated degree requirements and procedures must be approved by the Curriculum Committee as the
representative body of the faculty in matters pertaining to the curriculum.
 
The minimum grade point averages required for graduation are 2.0 overall and 2.0 in music. A student taking a
second major must earn a 2.0 in that major in order for it to be certified on the transcript.
 
If requirements for graduation change, students may elect to be bound by requirements published in
the Undergraduate Catalog in either their entering or their graduating year.
 
Engineering: The specific course requirements and total hours required for the bachelor’s degree vary with the
student’s major program. Detailed requirements for each program are shown in the specimen curricula in the
Courses of Study section.
 
Peabody: The specific course requirements and total hours required for the bachelor’s degree vary with the
student’s major program. Detailed requirements for each program are shown in the specimen curricula in the
Courses of Study section.
Scholarship Student Requirements (Blair, VUSE)
Blair: Students receiving honor scholarships through Blair School of Music must be enrolled full time, taking all
assigned music courses, must qualify for class standing, and must maintain each semester minimum grade point
averages of 2.0 overall and 2.7 in music. Students receiving the Cornelius Vanderbilt Honor Scholarship must
maintain a minimum 3.0 grade point average overall and 3.0 in music each year. Additional requirements may be
stipulated in scholarship award letters.
 
Honor scholarship awards are considered for renewal annually. Student work will be reviewed at the end of spring
semester for possible renewal for the following academic year. Temporary grades may adversely affect renewal. A
student who falls short of the requirements will normally have the scholarship for one semester of grace, after
which, if requirements are still not met, the scholarship will be lost.
Page 80 of 1019 

 
Students receiving scholarships or grants as part of their financial aid packages (not honor scholarships) must
qualify for class standing in order to be considered for renewal each year. Students receiving federal aid are
expected to make satisfactory academic progress as outlined in the chapter on Financial Information.
 
Engineering: Those students having honor scholarships are expected to maintain a 3.000 grade point average
while taking a minimum of 12 hours. Failure to maintain a 3.000 grade point average each year will result in the
cancellation of the scholarship.
Liberal Education Core Guidelines (PBDY)
Peabody: Applicants to Peabody College will be required to take the SAT I or ACT writing test and the SAT II
mathematics test. Students with majors in human and organizational development, cognitive studies, child studies,
or child development do not need the SAT II mathematics test. For applicants applying for Fall 2022 entry,
Vanderbilt is test optional. Scores from the ACT or SAT are not required to be considered for admission. Applicants
who want their test scores to be considered may self-report them on the application or may have official scores sent
to Vanderbilt by the testing agency. Official test scores are required for students who applied with testing and who
were admitted and enroll.
 
The following application of these scores will be made to the Peabody Liberal Education Core:
 
Writing Requirement
 
Before graduation, all Peabody students must successfully complete two writing courses and credit for the ENGL
1100s. Writing-intensive courses either have a “W” after the course number (A&S courses) or end with the digit "7"
(Peabody courses).
 
To earn credit for ENGL 1100, students must complete one of the following:
English 1100 
SAT: Combined score of at least 1220 on the Writing and Critical Reasoning sections, with a minimum score of
500 on each (test taken prior to March 2016).
SAT: Score of at least 660 on the Evidence-Based Reading and Writing section, with a minimum score of 27
on the Reading section and a minimum score of 28 on the Writing and Language section (test taken March
2016 or later).
ACT: Score of at least 27 on the English portion combined with a minimum score of 7 on the Writing portion
(test taken prior to September 2015).
ACT: Score of at least 27 on the English portion combined with a minimum score of 19 on the Writing portion
(test taken between September 2015 and September 2016).
ACT: Score of at least 30 on the English portion.
AP: Minimum score of 4 on the English Language or English Literature exam.
IB: Minimum score of 6 on the Higher level English A Literature or the Higher Level English A Language &
Literature exam.
Minimum score of 62 on the Tailwind Writing Skill and Reading Comprehension Proficiency Exam.
First-year seminars (courses labeled 1111) offered through the College of Arts and Science and Blair School of Music
may count as writing-intensive courses. Peabody freshmen may register for first-year seminars when open
registration begins if there are available seats in the course not reserved for Arts and Science students or Blair
students. Peabody students are not required to take a First-year Writing Seminar.
 
Mathematics
 
Page 81 of 1019 

Students with first majors in elementary, secondary, or special education with an SAT II Mathematics test score at or
above 620 (Level I) or at or above 570 (Level II) are exempt from three hours of the math component of the Liberal
Education Core mathematics category. Students with an exemption must take an additional three credit hours in
their Liberal Education Core elective category to have the minimum required sixty-hour core. Students must take a
statistics course if required for their major.
 
Students with first majors in child development, child studies, cognitive studies, or human and organizational
development must take six hours as stated in the Liberal Education Core mathematics category.
Progress Evaluation (PBDY)
Peabody: Students enrolled in Peabody College are expected to satisfy most Liberal Education Core requirements
during the freshman and sophomore years. Although legitimate circumstances sometimes force the postponement
of Liberal Education Core requirements, upper-level students are not expected to have a significant number of
Liberal Education Core requirements outstanding. A student who, in the opinion of the faculty adviser, the
department chair, or the associate dean for undergraduate academic affairs, is not making satisfactory progress
toward meeting Liberal Education Core or other degree requirements may be reported to the Undergraduate
Administrative Committee and is subject to being placed on academic probation by that committee. Students placed
on academic probation for failure to make satisfactory progress toward a degree must remove the deficiency in the
manner specified by the Administrative Committee.
Writing Portfolio (Blair)
Blair: Students in their senior year are required to submit a writing portfolio drawn from academic course work from
one or more classes to be evaluated by a faculty committee. Emphasis should be placed on demonstrating an
ability to write clearly and effectively and on the student’s ability to form connections across two or more
disciplines. Students are required to prepare a one-paragraph narrative explaining how the submitted work
demonstrates the required competencies.
Degree Audit Reports (Blair)
Blair: An online degree audit is available on YES to all Blair students, showing total hours earned, degree
requirements completed, and those still to be met. Students should examine the audit carefully with their faculty
advisers. Problems or suspected errors should be discussed immediately with the Blair Office of Academic Services.
Declaring of Major and of Second Major (PBDY)
Peabody: Peabody students declare a major as part of the application process prior to admission. In their first
semester, Peabody freshmen are expected to take course work recommended for the major into which they were
admitted. Students wishing to change into a different major within Peabody cannot declare this change until March
of their first year. Second majors must be declared no later than the second semester of the sophomore year. Also,
during the sophomore year, students majoring in secondary education and special education will be required to
declare their area of specialization or track.
Overlap in Course Work between Multiple Majors and Minors (PBDY)
Peabody: Students pursuing multiple majors and/or optional minors are limited in the amount of course work that
can be shared across their major and minor programs of study. If the major or minor is offered through a school
other than Peabody, the amount of course work that can be shared between that major or minor and other majors or
minors is determined by that school’s policies. For a major offered through Peabody College, at least 21 credit hours
need to be unique to that major. That is, 21 hours within the major cannot be used to count toward any other major
or minor. For a minor offered through Peabody College, at least 15 hours need to be unique to that minor. Students
in the School of Engineering may use courses taken in Peabody College for relevant second majors even if those
courses also fulfill a School of Engineering degree requirement.
Class Standing (A&S, Blair, VUSE, PBDY)
Arts & Science: The Administrative Committee determines how many semesters will be allowed for each part-time
student to attain sophomore, junior, or senior standing.
 
Page 82 of 1019 

The internal record of a student dropped from the university under these regulations shows the notation “Failed to
qualify for class standing.”
 
Sophomore Standing
 
A student qualifies for sophomore standing upon completion of 24 credit hours of work with a grade point average of
at least 1.800, completion of two regular semesters (fall or spring), and completion of the first-year writing
requirement: successful completion of English 1100 if required and successful completion of a First-Year Writing
Seminar (numbered 1111 in various disciplines). First-year students who fail to qualify for sophomore standing in
two semesters are placed on probation and must have the permission of the Administrative Committee to register
for a third semester. The third semester must be the summer semester at Vanderbilt. Normally, students who do
not qualify for sophomore standing during this third semester are dropped from the university.
 
Junior Standing
 
A student qualifies for junior standing upon completion of 54 credit hours of work with a grade point average of
1.900, completion of four regular semesters (fall or spring), and completion of a W course at any level (other than
ENGL 1100 or a First-Year Writing Seminar). Sophomores who fail to qualify for junior standing within two semesters
after qualifying for sophomore standing are placed on probation and must have the permission of the Administrative
Committee to register for another semester. This additional semester must be the summer semester at Vanderbilt.
Normally, students who do not qualify for junior standing in this additional semester are dropped from the
university.
 
Senior Standing
 
A student qualifies for senior standing upon completion of 84 credit hours of work with a grade point average of
2.000 and completion of six regular semesters (fall or spring). Juniors who fail to qualify for senior standing within
two semesters after qualifying for junior standing are placed on probation and must have the permission of the
Administrative Committee to register for another semester. This additional semester must be the summer semester
at Vanderbilt. Normally, students who do not qualify for senior standing in this additional semester are dropped
from the university.
 
Seniors who fail to maintain a minimum grade point average of 2.000 are placed on probation and must have the
permission of the Administrative Committee to register for another semester.
 
Blair: To qualify for sophomore standing, a student must complete a minimum of 24 hours with a grade point
average of 1.8 and have completed two regular semesters.
 
To qualify for junior standing, a student must complete a minimum of 54 hours with a grade point average of 1.9,
must complete MUTH 2200 and MUTH 2220, and must have completed four regular semesters.
 
To qualify for senior standing, a student must complete a minimum of 86 hours with a grade point average of 2.0
and have completed six regular semesters.
 
Engineering: School of Engineering students are promoted on the basis of cumulative GPA, hours earned, and
regular semesters in residence. For the purposes of promotion, a regular semester is defined as any fall or spring
Page 83 of 1019 

term in which a student is enrolled at Vanderbilt University. Test credit and transfer credit can be used to satisfy the
credit hour requirement.

Peabody: To qualify for sophomore standing, a freshman must earn at least 24 hours with a grade point average of
at least 1.800 and have completed two regular semesters. A freshman who fails to achieve sophomore standing at
the end of two regular semesters is placed on probation and has one additional semester in which to qualify for
sophomore standing. This additional semester must be the summer session at Vanderbilt. Normally, students who
fail to qualify for sophomore standing in the third semester are dropped from the university.
 
A student qualifies for junior standing by earning 54 hours with a grade point average of at least 1.900 and having
completed four regular semesters. Students who fail to qualify for junior standing at the end of two semesters after
qualifying for sophomore standing are placed on probation and must qualify in an additional semester. This third
semester must be the summer session at Vanderbilt. Normally, students who do not qualify for junior standing in
this additional semester will be dropped from the university.
 
A student qualifies for senior standing by earning 84 hours with a grade point average of at least 2.000 and having
completed six regular semesters. A student who fails to qualify for senior standing within two semesters of
qualifying for junior standing will be placed on probation and must qualify in one additional semester. This additional
semester must be the summer session at Vanderbilt. Normally, students who do not qualify for senior standing in
this additional semester will be dropped from the university.
Senior in Absentia (A&S)
Arts & Science: A student who wishes to earn a baccalaureate degree in the College of Arts and Science in
absentia must have (a) completed the AXLE requirements and all major requirements; (b) earned at least 105 credit
hours and a grade point average of 2.000 with at least 60 credit hours earned in a minimum of four semesters of
residence in the College of Arts and Science; (c) been accepted at a professional or graduate school where, during
the first year, the remaining credit hours needed for graduation can be earned; and (d) obtained the approval of the
major department and an associate dean of the College of Arts and Science. Students who have completed fewer
than 105 credit hours may petition the Administrative Committee for special consideration.
 
The limitation on credit hours outside the College of Arts and Science applies to all bachelor of arts candidates.
 
Students in the senior-in-absentia program pay a minimum semester tuition charge to the College of Arts and
Science (see Financial Information).
Examinations
Examinations (A&S, Blair, VUSE)
Arts & Science: Each department establishes procedures for evaluating student performance, and normally the
method of evaluation is the responsibility of the course instructor. At the beginning of the semester instructors
should clearly state the evaluation procedures, including types of examinations, to be used in their courses.
Students should have adequate opportunity during the semester to demonstrate their knowledge of the subject
matter and should be given an indication of their progress in the course prior to the deadline for dropping courses.
Page 84 of 1019 

Instructors are cautioned against placing excessive weight on the final examination when determining a student’s
grade in a course.
 
Blair: All examinations are conducted under the honor system. Primary and alternate exam schedules, which allow
two hours for a final exam in each course, are listed on the University Registrar's website. The instructor may use
the alternate schedule in addition to, but not instead of, the primary schedule.
 
Alternatives to standard in-class final examinations, such as term papers or take-home, self-scheduled, or oral
examinations may be given at the instructor’s discretion. A take-home exam is distributed at the last regular class
meeting and must be completed by the latest time scheduled for the final examination.
 
Performance examinations are scheduled by area coordinators. Students giving full recitals during the semester
may be exempted from performance examinations at the discretion of the instructor. If performance examinations
are scheduled on a reading day (the day after classes end, when no course examinations are scheduled), students
are also given the choice of a different day for their performance examinations.
 
A student who misses a final examination may be eligible to receive the grade M (see Temporary Grades).
 
Engineering: Examinations are usually given at the end of each semester. Exams will be no longer than three
hours in length and are given according to the schedule published in the Final Examination Schedule. The School of
Engineering does not offer an alternate examination schedule. All examinations are conducted under the honor
system. Students must be present for all their scheduled final exams or otherwise will default on their exams.
Dead Week (A&S, Blair, PBDY)
Arts & Science: No examinations of any type—including quizzes, hour examinations, and portions of final
examinations—are allowed during the last week of classes; papers and in-class presentations are permitted during
dead week. The Administrative Committee may grant special permission to the instructor in charge of a course to
give laboratory examinations during the last regular laboratory period of the last week of classes. The last week of
classes is defined as the last seven calendar days preceding the end of classes. If, for example, classes end on
Tuesday, then the “dead week” begins the preceding Wednesday and lasts through Tuesday. Students should notify
the Dean’s Office of Undergraduate Education of any violation.
 
Blair: The last week of classes, i.e., the last seven calendar days before the final examination period each semester,
is designated as dead week. No examinations of any type, including quizzes, portions of final examinations, recitals,
or ensemble performances, may be given during this time without the express written permission of the dean and
notification of students at least two weeks before dead week. Violations should be reported to the dean.
 
Peabody: Because Peabody classes integrate theory and practice, many courses include significant semester-long
group and individual projects that culminate in papers, presentations, simulations, or other activities at the end of
the semester. Therefore, while instructors are discouraged from scheduling quizzes, tests, or short-term
assignments for the last week of the semester, Peabody’s “dead week” policy does not prohibit assignments during
the week before finals.
Final Examinations (A&S)
Arts & Science: The primary and alternate final examination schedules issued each semester allow two hours for a
final examination in each course. Each in-class final examination must be given at the time indicated on the primary
schedule. The alternate schedule is used only if the instructor decides to give an in-class examination at two times.
The final examination period lasts for about a week and a half.
 
Page 85 of 1019 

Alternatives to the standard in-class final examination are permitted at the instructor’s discretion. Some examples
are take-home examinations, oral examinations, and term papers; there need not be a final examination if
adequate evaluation procedures have been used during the term. A take-home or oral examination should make
approximately the same demand on a student’s time as an in-class examination and should be conducted during
the final examination period. A take-home examination must be distributed at the last regular class meeting and
must be completed by either the primary or the alternate examination date, whichever is later.
 
All examinations are conducted under the Honor System.
 
The instructor’s record of grades given during a course and any final examination papers not returned to students
must be kept on file by the instructor for the first month of the semester following the conclusion of the course. For
spring semester and summer session courses, this rule means the first month of the fall semester.
 
Monitoring these regulations is the responsibility of the departments, under the supervision of the Dean’s Office of
Undergraduate Education. Variations from the regulations—such as changing the time of an in-class final
examination for an entire class—are allowed only on approval of the Administrative Committee.
Comprehensive Examinations (A&S)
Arts & Science: Any department or interdisciplinary program may require a comprehensive examination of its
major students as a condition of graduation.
Senior Re-Examination (A&S, Blair, VUSE, PBDY)
Arts & Science: A candidate for graduation who fails not more than one course in the final semester may be
allowed one re- examination, provided the course failed prevents the student’s graduation, and provided the student
could pass the course by passing a re-examination. Certain courses may be excluded from re-examination. The re-
examination must be requested through the Dean’s Office of Undergraduate Education, and if approved, it is given
immediately after the close of the last semester of the student’s senior year. A student who passes the re-
examination will receive a D– in the course. The terms and administration of senior re-examination are the
responsibility of the school that offers the course.
 
Blair: A candidate for graduation who fails not more than one course in the final semester may be allowed one re-
examination, provided the course failed would prevent the student’s graduation, and provided the student could
pass the course by passing a re-examination. Certain courses may be excluded from re-examination. The re-
examination must   be requested through the student’s associate dean’s office, and, if approved, it is given
immediately after the close of the last semester of the student’s senior year. A student who passes the re-
examination will receive a D- in the course. The terms and administration of senior re-examination are the
responsibility of the school that offers the course. Note: For engineering students taking engineering courses, the
senior re-examination policy applies if a student fails not more than one course in the senior year.
 
Engineering: A candidate for graduation who fails not more than one course in the final semester may be allowed
one re-examination, provided the course failed prevents the student’s graduation, and provided the student could
pass the course by passing a re-examination. Certain courses may be excluded from re-examination. The re-
examination must be requested through the student’s Dean’s Office, and, if approved, it is given immediately after
the close of the last semester of the student’s senior year. A student who passes the re-examination will receive
a D- in the course. The terms and administration of senior re-examination are the responsibility of the school that
offers the course. For engineering students, this senior re-examination policy applies if a student fails a course in
the final semester or fails a course in the penultimate semester that is not offered in the final semester, provided
that failure in that one course is the only thing preventing the student’s graduation.
 
Peabody: A candidate for graduation who fails not more than one course in the final semester may be allowed one
re-examination, provided the course failed prevents the student’s graduation, and provided the student could pass
the course by passing a re-examination. Certain courses may be excluded from re-examination.
Page 86 of 1019 

 
The re-examination must be requested through the Office of the Associate Deans, and if approved, it is given
immediately after the close of the last semester of the student’s senior year. A student who passes the re-
examination will receive a D– in the course. The terms and administration of senior re-examination are the
responsibility of the school that offers the course.
Academic Standards & Discipline
Academic Standing (VUSE)
Engineering:
 
Good Standing
 
To remain in good academic standing, a student must pursue a program leading toward a degree in the School of
Engineering and meet all GPA and hours earned requirements at the conclusion of each fall and spring semester. A
first-year student must successfully complete at least 12 hours and earn at least a 1.8 semester GPA each semester
to remain in good standing. A sophomore, junior, or senior must complete at least 12 hours and earn at least a 2.0
semester GPA each semester to remain in good standing. In addition, a student must also promote to the next
academic class every two regular semesters according to the VUSE promotion standards (above) to remain in good
standing.
 
Probation
 
Students who fail to meet the GPA, hours earned, or class standing promotion standards required to remain in good
standing will be placed on academic probation. Students who are not progressing toward a degree in the School of
Engineering may be placed on academic probation. Students who fail to return to good standing after a semester on
probation will be continued on probation or dismissed. Students who are on probation for three semesters risk
dismissal.
 
A student authorized by the Administrative Committee to carry fewer than 12 hours because of illness or for some
other approved reason may be placed on probation if the student’s work is deemed unsatisfactory.
 
Required Leave of Absence
 
Under certain circumstances, a student may be required to take a semester-long leave of absence from the
university. Such a leave may be required for students for whom one or more of the following conditions apply:
Failing to pass 6 or more credit hours in a semester;
Earning a semester grade point average of 1.4 or less; or
Failing to improve academic achievement while on probation.
Dismissal
 
Any student who is deemed by the Administrative Committee not to be making satisfactory progress toward a
degree in engineering will be dismissed from the School of Engineering and from Vanderbilt University. Satisfactory
progress includes completing required courses in a timely manner and maintaining a 2.000 GPA in all courses, in the
school, and in the student’s major. Causes of dismissal include:
Failure of all courses in any semester
Page 87 of 1019 

Three or more semesters on probation
Failure to promote to the next class standing after three semesters
Failure to progress toward a degree in the School of Engineering
Dismissed students are eligible to apply for reinstatement to the School of Engineering and to Vanderbilt University
after one calendar year. The reinstatement process is outlined at registrar.vanderbilt.edu/reinstatement. Students
who are dismissed and later apply for reinstatement are ineligible to receive transfer credit for courses taken while
dismissed.
Sudden Academic Insufficiency (Blair, PBDY)
Blair: Any student who fails by a wide margin to reach prescribed levels of academic achievement, either at the end
of a semester or at mid-semester, is reviewed by the associate dean’s office in conjunction with the academic and
studio adviser(s). If the student is not making satisfactory progress towards the degree, the student may be placed
on probation or may be advised or required to take a leave of absence or advised to withdraw from the university.
 
Appeals of such findings should be addressed to the Blair Curriculum Committee.
 
Peabody: Any student who fails by a wide margin to reach prescribed levels of academic achievement, either at
the end of a semester or at mid-semester, or who has been placed on probation more than once is reviewed by the
Peabody Undergraduate Administrative Committee. The Committee considers each case within the general
guidelines for maintenance of satisfactory academic standing and may take any of several actions, among which are
the following:
The student may be placed on probation;
The student may be advised to take a leave of absence or to withdraw from the university;
The student may be required to take an academic probationary leave of absence;
The student may be dismissed from the university.
Under certain circumstances, a student who has been formally dismissed may be readmitted to Peabody. The
Peabody Undergraduate Administrative Committee must review and approve any request for readmission.
Academic Discipline (A&S)
Arts & Sciences: The College of Arts and Science requires each student to maintain an academic record that will
permit graduation according to a specified schedule. Students are considered to fall short of the expected rate of
progress when
1. They pass fewer than 12 credit hours in a semester or have a semester grade point average lower than
1.500; or
2. In a summer they take 12 or more credit hours but pass fewer than 12 credit hours or earn a grade point
average lower than 1.500; or
3. They fail to achieve sophomore, junior, or senior standing within the time allowed; or
4. They accumulate more than two probations after the freshman year, in which case they will normally be
dropped from the university; or
5. As first-semester freshmen they pass fewer than two courses or earn a semester grade point average lower
than 1.000, in which case they may be required to take a probationary leave of absence; or
6. As first-semester freshmen they earn fewer than 9 credit hours or a semester grade point average lower than
1.500, in which case they may be offered a choice (see Semester Requirements below).
Any student who falls somewhat short of the prescribed levels of academic achievement is normally placed on
probation. Any student who fails by a wide margin to reach these levels or who has been placed on probation more
than once is reviewed by the Administrative Committee, and may be dropped from the university without having
previously been placed on academic probation. The committee considers each case within the framework of the
guidelines  outlined below and may take any of several actions, among which are the following:
1. The student may be placed on probation;
2. The student may be advised to take a leave of absence or to withdraw from the university;
3. The student may be required to take a leave of absence;
4. The student may be dropped from the university.
Semester Requirements (A&S)
Page 88 of 1019 

Arts & Science: Full-time students are expected to earn each semester at least 12 credit hours and a minimum
grade point average of 1.500. Students who fall short of these levels are normally placed on probation. Students are
removed from probation after earning at least 12 credit hours and a semester grade point average of 1.500 or
better, assuming they have fulfilled the requirements for class standing stated below.
 
First-year students who pass fewer than two regular courses in their first regular semester or who earn a semester
grade point average lower than 1.000 have so seriously compromised their academic standing that they may be
required to take a probationary leave of absence until the beginning of the following fall semester.
 
First-year students who earn fewer than 9 credit hours or a grade point average lower than 1.500 in the fall may, at
the discretion of the Administrative Committee, choose a probationary leave for the spring and return the next fall
with two semesters in which to qualify for sophomore standing.
 
A student on probationary leave may not earn credit at another institution for transfer to Vanderbilt. In appropriate
cases the Administrative Committee may prescribe conditions that must be satisfied before the student returns from
a probationary leave. Students who do not choose to return at the end of a probationary leave but want to return
later are required to apply for reinstatement.
 
After their first year, full-time students may not be placed on probation more than twice (continuance on probation
for a second semester counts as another probation). If a student’s performance is deficient a third time, the student
is dropped from the university.
 
Students who have been authorized to carry fewer than 12 credit hours because of illness or outside employment
may be placed on academic probation if their work is deemed unsatisfactory by the Administrative Committee; they
are removed from probation when the committee deems their work satisfactory. If they are not removed from
probation after a reasonable period of time, such students are dropped.
 
The internal record of a student dropped from the university under these regulations shows the notation “Dropped
for scholastic deficiency.”
Academic Probation and Dismissal (Blair, PBDY)
Blair: Students are placed on probation if they fail to meet class standing benchmarks, as noted above. Students on
probation must qualify for class standing in one additional semester or risk being dropped from the university.
 
Students are placed on academic probation: if they fail to meet class standing benchmarks; if they complete fewer
than 12 hours in a fall or spring semester except in cases involving documented mitigating circumstances (illness,
injury, or family emergency); or if their semester grade point averages fall below 1.8 overall or 2.0 in music. In
addition, first-year students are placed on academic probation if they do not complete one writing course.
 
Incomplete grades may adversely affect class standing or grade point averages.
 
Students on academic probation may not transfer summer study credit, elect to take courses on a Pass/Fail basis,
earn credit by departmental examination, or participate in any extracurricular performance activity. They are
required to participate in a special academic advising program. Students will be placed on probation no more than
twice. Students who are candidates for probation a third time will be dropped from the university.
 
Peabody: After achieving sophomore standing, the student may not be on academic probation for more than two
Page 89 of 1019 

semesters. A student whose academic record warrants a third semester of probation normally will be dropped from
the university. Students will be placed on academic probation if any of the following conditions apply:
 
Freshmen
1. The student’s cumulative grade point average falls below 1.800. Probation is removed (assuming there is no
other reason for the probation) when the student’s grade point average is raised to 1.800 or above.
2. The student fails to earn at least 12 hours in a regular semester as a freshman. Probation is removed when
the student earns at least 12 hours in a subsequent semester and/or is judged to be making satisfactory
academic progress.
3. The student fails to achieve sophomore standing in the required two semesters. Probation is removed when
the student achieves sophomore standing.
4. Freshmen who pass fewer than two regular courses in their first regular semester or who earn a grade point
average lower than 1.000 have so seriously compromised their academic standing that they may be required
to take an academic probationary leave of absence during the spring semester.
Sophomores 
1. The student’s cumulative grade point average falls below 1.800. Probation is removed (assuming there is no
other reason for the probation) when the student’s grade point average is raised to 1.800 or above, except
that at the end of the second regular semester the student must qualify for junior standing. 
2. The student fails to earn at least 12 hours in a regular semester as a sophomore. Probation is removed when
the student earns at least 12 hours in a subsequent semester and/or is judged to be making satisfactory
academic progress.
3. The student is placed on probation by the Undergraduate Administrative Committee for failure to make
satisfactory progress toward the degree. Probation is removed when the specified conditions are met.
4. The student fails to achieve junior standing in the required two semesters after achieving sophomore
standing. Probation is removed when junior standing is achieved.
Juniors 
1. The student’s cumulative grade point average falls below 1.900. Probation is removed (assuming there is no
other reason for the probation) when the grade point average is raised to 900 or above, except that at the
end of the second regular semester the student must qualify for senior standing.
2. The student fails to earn at least 12 hours in a regular semester as a junior. Probation is removed when the
student earns at least 12 hours in a subsequent semester and/or is judged to be making satisfactory
academic progress.
3. The student is placed on probation by the Undergraduate Administrative Committee for failure to make
satisfactory progress toward the degree. Probation is removed when the specified conditions are met.
4. The student fails to achieve senior standing in the required two semesters after achieving junior standing.
Probation is removed when senior standing is achieved.
Seniors
1. The student’s cumulative grade point average falls below 2.000. Probation is removed when the grade point
average is raised to 2.000 or above. 
2. The student fails to earn at least 12 hours in a regular semester as a senior, unless the semester is one in
which the student needs fewer than 12 hours in order to complete the requirements for graduation (see
section on Course Load, above). Probation is removed when the student earns at least 12 hours in a
subsequent semester and/or is judged to be making satisfactory academic progress and/or completes the
requirements for graduation.
Petitions and Appeals (A&S, PBDY)
Arts & Science: The Administrative Committee of the College of Arts and Science entertains petitions from
currently enrolled students for exceptions to academic regulations. Any student subject to action by the
Administrative Committee may appeal that action to the committee in writing. Further appeals from decisions of the
committee follow standard university policies as described in the Student Handbook.
 
Peabody: The procedures of the appeal process pertaining to academic matters within Peabody College are listed
below. Please see the chapter “Student Accountability” in the Vanderbilt University Student Handbook for a
description of the appeal process for non-academic matters.
Page 90 of 1019 

 
Petitions for exceptions to academic policies, appeals of academic policy implementations by Peabody Dean’s Office
staff, and appeals of academic actions by the Undergraduate Administrative Committee (UAC) Chair (e.g., letters of
dismissal) may be directed to the full UAC.
 
Petitions and appeals should be sent to the Peabody Office of Academic Services
- peabodyacademicservices@vanderbilt.edu, Peabody Administration Building.
 
A student may ask the UAC to reconsider a decision if the student has new information to offer. The chair of the UAC
will decide whether the full UAC will reconsider. Requests for reconsideration of UAC decisions should be sent to the
above address.
 
A final, negative decision of the UAC may be appealed to the dean of Peabody College (at the above address), who
may assign an associate dean to handle the matter on the dean’s behalf. The dean or associate dean will consult
with the UAC and other relevant faculty or staff as part of the review of the decision.
 
Further appeals beyond Peabody College should be directed to the Provost’s Office.
Enrollment Status & Changes
Transfer Students (Blair)
Alternate Track (PBDY)
Leave of Absence (A&S, Blair, VUSE, PBDY)
Returning to the College (A&S)
Withdrawal from the University (A&S, VUSE, PBDY)
Change of Address (A&S, Blair, VUSE)
 
Transfer Students (Blair)
Blair: Transfer applicants must comply with university standards (see the chapter on Admissions). The required
audition is of major importance in the evaluation of any application. Composition applicants must submit a
composition portfolio and interview with a member of the composition faculty.
 
Transfer students must submit catalog copy and course syllabi from the previous institution(s). A level of
performance study is assigned based on the entrance audition. Credit for courses is subject to evaluation. Music
courses may require an examination to verify placement and/or credit at Vanderbilt, and credit for non-music
courses must be approved through the YES Transfer Credit portal. Transfer students must complete at least half the
credit required for the degree, or 63 hours, at the Blair School. See also, Transfer courses.
 
Intra-university transfer. Students intending to transfer within the university should meet with the head of academic
advising and file appropriate paperwork. For students transferring out of the B.Mus. or B.Mus.Arts program, music
fees are covered through the end of the final term as a B.Mus. or B.Mus.Arts student. All students are expected to
maintain a minimum of 3 credit hours within their home school until transfer is approved. First-year students are
ineligible for transfer status until the end of their second semester. Students who transferred to Vanderbilt
University from another institution are eligible for intra-university transfer after having completed one semester in
residence and having achieved sophomore standing. See also, the chapter on Admissions.
Page 91 of 1019 

Alternate Track (PBDY)
Peabody: Occasionally students find that it will be necessary to reduce their normal load due to medical reasons,
varsity athletics, or other circumstances. The result is that they will accomplish the bachelor of science degree in
nine or ten semesters instead of eight. In such cases, the student may request Alternate Track status. After
discussing this option with their parents and faculty adviser, students petition the Associate Dean for Undergraduate
Academic Affairs for permission. This normally takes place during the sophomore year. Additional information is
available by contacting the Associate Dean for Undergraduate Academic Affairs.
Leave of Absence (A&S, Blair, VUSE, PBDY)
Arts & Science: A student desiring a leave of absence should obtain instructions from the Dean’s Office of
Undergraduate Education in the College of Arts and Science. All students who have completed one regular
(fall/spring) semester at Vanderbilt are eligible, provided they have not been dropped by the university and are not
dropped at the end of the semester during which application is made. Students may take a leave no more than twice
during their career in the College of Arts and Science.
 
Leaves are granted for one semester or for a year. Applications should be completed before the end of the fall
semester for a leave of absence during the spring semester, and before August 15 for a leave of absence during the
fall semester (or for the academic year). If the leave is approved, the student must keep the Office of the University
Registrar informed of any change of address while on leave.
 
A student who takes a medical leave after mid-semester is expected to be on leave for the following regular
semester as well. A student who plans to return from medical leave must submit appropriate documentation to the
Dean’s Office of Undergraduate Education and the Office of Student Care Coordination.
 
A student in good standing who seeks to transfer to Vanderbilt credit earned elsewhere while on leave of absence
must obtain permission in advance from the Office of Undergraduate Education. Requests for leave of absence for
purpose of semester study away may be allowed if the semester study-away institution is domestic to the student.
Requests for leave of absence plus semester study away are not allowed if the semester study-away institution is
international to the student.
 
Registration information is emailed to students on leave of absence. A student failing to register at the conclusion of
the stated leave will be withdrawn from the university and must apply for reinstatement.
 
Blair: A student in good standing may, with the approval of the associate dean, take leave of absence for one or two
semesters. Application forms, available from the Blair Office of Academic Services, must be submitted by 1
December for spring semester leave or by 1 May for fall semester.
 
Students planning to study elsewhere while on leave (elective courses) must have prior approval if credits are to be
transferable. Upon the student’s return, a performance examination during the first two weeks of the semester may
be needed to determine the student’s standing in the major performance area.
 
Registration notifications are emailed to students on leave. A student failing to register at the conclusion of the
stated leave will be withdrawn from the university and must apply for readmission.
 
Students who have been on leave of absence and not enrolled for three or more semesters or who leave the
university while on academic probation must re-audition and achieve the approval of the associate dean prior to
readmission.
 
Page 92 of 1019 

Engineering: A student at Vanderbilt or one who has been admitted to Vanderbilt may, with the approval of his or
her academic dean, take an official leave of absence for as much as two semesters and a summer session. Leave of
absence forms are available in the Office of Academic Services. A student who fails to register in the university at
the end of the leave will be withdrawn from the university.
 
Peabody: A student desiring a leave of absence should obtain the appropriate forms from the Peabody Office of
Academic Services website: peabody.vanderbilt.edu/admin-offices/oas/downloads.php. All students are eligible,
provided they have not been dropped by the university and are not dropped at the end of the semester during which
application is made.
 
Leaves are granted for one or two semesters. Applications should be completed before the end of the fall semester
for a leave of absence during the spring semester and before 15 August for a leave of absence during the fall
semester (or for the academic year). If the leave is approved, the student must keep the Dean’s Office informed of
any change of address while on leave.
 
Should a student seek to transfer to Vanderbilt credit earned elsewhere while on a leave of absence, it is mandatory
that permission be obtained in advance from the Dean’s Office. Petitions for leaves of this type must be filed at
least one month before the close of the preceding semester.
 
While the student is on leave, registration information will be emailed to his or her Vanderbilt email address. A
student failing to register at the conclusion of the stated leave will be withdrawn from the university and must apply
for readmission.
 
Students who wish to participate in a non-Vanderbilt program in the United States, abroad, or at sea should apply
for a leave of absence for the relevant semester. To qualify for such a leave, a student must be in good standing at
Vanderbilt with at least a 2.700 grade point average as of the date of application. Students must obtain prior
approval for the leave of absence and for the credits to be taken in other programs if the credits are to be
transferred to Vanderbilt. Final approval of leaves of absence always rests with the Dean’s Office. See the section on
Transfer Credit in this chapter.
Returning to the College (A&S)
Arts & Science: Students on leave of absence return to the university at the end of the leave. If they do not return
at that time and want to return later, they must apply to the Office of the University Registrar for reinstatement.
Students who are advised to withdraw from the university determine whether or not to return in consultation with
the Dean’s Office of Undergraduate Education. Students who have been dropped may apply to the Office of the
University Registrar for reinstatement; in most cases reinstatement is not granted unless there has been an
intervening period of at least a year. The Office of the University Registrar forwards all documents to the
Administrative Committee, which considers each case on an individual basis. Reinstatement is competitive, and
there is no assurance that it will be granted.
 
Students reinstated after having been advised to withdraw or after having been dropped are automatically on final
probation. If they fail to regain good standing and to maintain it until graduation, they are dropped again with little
prospect for reinstatement. Application deadlines for reinstatement are as follows: July 15 for the fall semester,
November 15 for the spring semester, and April 1 for the summer session.
Withdrawal from the University (A&S, VUSE, PBDY)
Arts & Sciences: Students proposing to withdraw from the university during a regular term must report to the
Dean’s Office of Undergraduate Education in the College of Arts and Science to initiate proper clearance procedures.
If withdrawal from the university is officially authorized, the student will receive withdrawal grades on the same
basis as a student withdrawing from a particular course or courses. (See the section on Period for Withdrawal under
Registration above).
Page 93 of 1019 

 
Engineering: A student proposing to withdraw from the university must notify the Office of Academic Services of
the School of Engineering so that proper clearance may be granted and incomplete work is not charged as a failure
against the student’s record.
 
Peabody: Students proposing to withdraw from the university during any semester must report to the Associate
Dean for Undergraduate Academic Affairs  to initiate proper clearance procedures. Students are graded on the same
basis as if withdrawing from a course. Students who withdraw before the end of the eighth week of classes receive a
partial refund of tuition (see the section on Financial Information).
Change of Address (A&S, Blair, VUSE)
Arts & Science: Students are responsible for keeping the university informed of their correct mailing addresses,
both school and home. They should notify the university, through the Office of the University Registrar, online or in
writing, of any address changes as soon as possible. They are provided an opportunity to review address information
at registration. The university will consider notices and other information delivered if mailed to the address on file in
the Office of the University Registrar.
 
Blair: Any change of address should be submitted to the Office of the University Registrar at yes.vanderbilt.edu.
The university will consider notices or other information delivered if mailed to the address currently on file.
 
Engineering: Any change of address should be reported to the Office of the University Registrar using the YES
online form. The university will consider notices or other information delivered if mailed to the address on file in YES.
Special Programs
Immersion Vanderbilt (Blair, VUSE)
Blair: To fulfill the university requirement of Immersion Vanderbilt, a student must participate in an intensive
learning experience that takes place in and beyond the classroom and culminates in the creation of a tangible final
project. This requirement applies to all students who entered Vanderbilt as first-year students in or after summer
2018, as second-year students in or after summer 2019, or as third-year students in or after summer 2020.
 
Immersion Vanderbilt is divided into four broad pathways: civic and professional, creative expression, international,
and research. The pathway selected by the student may focus on one or more than one of these areas and should
provide a structure upon which students can brainstorm, plan, and execute their immersive projects across multiple
years.
 
Most Blair students will take advantage of the senior recital experience or honors thesis in
ethnomusicology/musicology to satisfy the requirements of Immersion Vanderbilt. However, students may choose to
pursue an Immersion plan outside their home program. Students should consult the Office of Experiential Learning
and Immersion Vanderbilt. Completion of the Immersion Vanderbilt graduation requirement will be shown on the
student's degree audit, and the title of the Immersion project will be added to the student's
transcript. vanderbilt.edu/immersion
 
Engineering: Immersion Vanderbilt (vanderbilt.edu/immersion) allows students to pursue a multi-year path to be
curious, to develop their passions and to learn by experience. To fulfill the university requirement of Immersion
Vanderbilt, a student must participate in immersive experiences and then complete a culminating project that is
based on one specific immersive experience.
 
The experiential learning may focus on one or more areas of student interest.  Most engineering students will take
Page 94 of 1019 

advantage of a four-year engineering design experience to satisfy the requirements of Immersion Vanderbilt. Each
engineering major offers such a multi-year experience within its curriculum. Students whose plans include
professional development may also pursue industrial internships. A research path can engage the student in
discovery through research in engineering or other fields. While most engineering students will select an immersion
experience associated with their major, students can pursue an Immersion plan outside their home program. For
example, students interested in creative expression might develop a performance piece, exhibit, or artistic work,
while those interested in international study may explore firsthand the culture, language, and history of other
countries. Students interested in such immersion plans should consult the Office of Experiential Learning and
Immersion Vanderbilt.
 
The Immersion Vanderbilt process is composed of several phases. The initial step involves the creation of a plan that
identifies the intended Immersive experience. Before students start their immersive experience, they will submit the
Immersive Experience Declaration Form. Students may submit multiple immersive experience forms throughout
their time at Vanderbilt University. After each experience, a self-reflection component is required.
 
Immersion Vanderbilt culminates in the creation of a final project arising from one of the experiences. Approval and
assessment of the project is done by the supervising school or college. Senior design projects in the School of
Engineering satisfy the final project requirement for Immersion Vanderbilt, with students presenting the results of
their design project at the school’s Design Day. For students completing other immersion projects, Immersion
coordinates a series of showcases open to the entire campus where students display their projects. Upon completion
of the project, Immersion Vanderbilt conveys that the requirements have been met by showing completion of the
Immersion Vanderbilt graduation requirement on the student’s degree audit and adding the Immersion project to
the student’s transcript.
Study Abroad (Blair)
Blair: Five Vanderbilt study abroad programs are coordinated with the degree programs in music: the IES programs
in Milan, Italy; Vienna, Austria; and in Amsterdam, The Netherlands; the DIS program at the Royal Danish Academy
of Music in Copenhagen, Denmark, and the IFSA/Butler program at the University of Sydney and Sydney
Conservatorium of Music in Sydney, Australia. These programs include provisions for lesson and ensemble credits,
contingent upon audition and admission to the program. These will count towards the Blair music core and are
covered at least in part by regular tuition and fees, although students are responsible for any instrument rental fees
they accrue. All programs also allow for a range of liberal arts and elective credits. Further information can be
obtained from the Vanderbilt Global Education Office, Suite 103, Student Life Center, or vanderbilt.edu/geo, and
from Blair’s associate dean.
 
Blair students may also elect any of the Vanderbilt-approved study abroad programs; see descriptions under “Study
Abroad” in the front chapters of the catalog. Blair students in these programs have typically enrolled in music
electives, courses in the liberal arts core, and course work toward minors and second majors. Students in these
programs typically arrange alternative performance or composition instruction, and those fees are usually not
covered by tuition. It should be noted that if a program has been approved by Vanderbilt students must enroll in the
program via the Global Education Office. In no case, after matriculating at Vanderbilt, may a student apply to
participate in a program for transfer credit through a different university, or through an external agency, and then
seek to transfer that credit into Vanderbilt. Any student studying abroad must register with Vanderbilt's global travel
office.
Blair-Specific Provisions
Internships (Blair)
Blair: The Career Center assists students interested in internship opportunities in the music industry and elsewhere;
there are opportunities in many states of the U.S. and also abroad, both during the academic year and in the
summer. A student serving as an intern may register for MENT 3880, 3881, or 3882 as a corollary if credit is desired.
Students with summer internships that require an academic component must register for credit
(vanderbilt.edu/career/career-exploration/internships/summer-internship-subsidy/). A maximum of 6 hours of
internship credit may be counted toward the degree. Students are responsible for finding a faculty sponsor; a
written study plan must be approved by the faculty sponsor and the Blair associate dean no later than the tenth day
of classes. Internship paperwork is available on the Blair School website at blair.vanderbilt.edu/academics.
Page 95 of 1019 

Performance Instruction: B. Mus. and B. Mus. Arts Degrees (Blair)
Blair: Fees. Performance instruction fees are waived for B.Mus. and B.Mus.Arts students. A one-time music
technology fee is charged to each first-year student.
 
Elective credit. B.Mus. and B.Mus.Arts students taking a second instrument normally enroll in 1100-level
performance instruction for 1 or 2 hours elective credit. Consent of the instructor is required. B.Mus. and B.Mus.Arts
students who have declared a minor instrument also register for performance instruction at the 1100 level; consent
of the instructor and notification of the Blair Office of Academic Services are required.
 
Composition Majors. Students register for performance instruction at the 1100 level. A minimum of 6 semesters of
study totaling 6 credit hours is required.
 
Integrated Studies Majors, Integrated Studies/Teacher Education Majors, Jazz Studies Majors, and B.Mus.Arts
students. First-year students and sophomores register for 2100-level performance instruction in their primary area.
Juniors and seniors register for 4100-level performance instruction in their primary area. A minimum of 8 semesters
totaling 16 credit hours required; performance instruction required every semester in residence.
 
Performance Majors. First-year students and sophomores register for 2200-level performance instruction in their
primary area. Juniors and seniors register for 4200-level instruction in their primary area. A minimum of 8 semesters
totaling 32 hours (instrumental performance majors) or 28 hours (vocal performance majors) required; performance
instruction required every semester in residence.
Upper Divisional Hearing (Blair)
Blair: Requirements for performance majors include an upper divisional hearing in the sophomore year to
determine continuance in the performance degree program and permit subsequent enrollment in upper division
study at the 4200 level. Students are required to perform a program of twenty to thirty minutes for a faculty
committee convened by the studio instructor or by the department chair. The committee will normally consist of the
student’s studio teacher and at least two additional members of the department. Memorization is required as
appropriate, and where called for, collaboration with piano is expected.
 
The student must consult with the studio instructor regarding appropriate repertoire. Instrumental selections must
be chosen from the solo repertoire and should represent diverse historical periods. Percussionists must perform on
keyboard percussion, timpani, and snare drum and/or multiple percussion. String repertoire must include solo Bach.
Pianists must perform a 30-minute memorized program of solo piano literature representing at least three style
periods. Vocal repertoire must include a minimum of five songs of contrasting periods and styles, using three
languages (Italian, English, and either French or German).
 
Failure to pass this hearing demonstrates a lack of the requisite skills to graduate in performance at the Blair School,
necessitating transfer to another degree program. A student may petition the faculty once for a second hearing,
with entirely different repertoire, to take place before the end of the first semester of the junior year
Pre-Recital Hearing (Blair)
Blair: All students (excepting composition) giving required recitals and any student who wishes to give a recital in
the Blair building must pass a hearing, held at least three weeks before the recital. After establishing a recital date,
the student, with guidance from the studio instructor, will assemble a recital hearing committee, consisting of two
additional faculty members, one of whom must be from outside the student’s performing area. For integrated
studies/teacher education students, the committee will normally consist of the studio instructor, a teacher education
faculty member, and at least one additional faculty member. For non-required, non-credit recitals, the hearing
committee may be from within the department. For any recital involving a student’s second performing medium, the
student must seek approval from the studio instructor and area coordinator of the secondary and primary
performing areas; in addition, a full-time faculty member from the secondary performing area must be part of the
Page 96 of 1019 

hearing committee. The student must notify the recital hearing committee, in writing, of the hearing date, recital
date, time, and place. Senior composition recitals are screened in advance at the department level.
 
For a required junior or senior recital, the repertoire will normally encompass three major style periods, as
appropriate to the medium; at least one work in a contemporary idiom will be included in either the junior or senior
recital. For teacher education students, a conducting component must be included on the required senior recital. For
jazz studies students, an original composition or arrangement must be included on the required senior recital. A
required senior recital must also include written or spoken program notes, visual media, or other audience
engagement component, with the approval of the studio instructor. The hearing committee should hear all of the
recital repertoire. Grading of the hearing is on a Pass/Fail basis, with written faculty comments. If a student fails the
hearing, another must be scheduled. Only two recital hearings in one semester are permitted.
 
For students also choosing the senior recital to fulfill Immersion Vanderbilt, the recital program and audience
engagement component should be a deeper, more intensive project that integrates classroom knowledge with
experience. The student will work with the project’s primary Immersion adviser (usually the studio teacher) to
develop a plan relevant to the student’s recital. While there are no specific requirements, examples may be found in
the Blair Student Handbook. The student’s Immersion adviser will ultimately decide if the plan fulfills the Immersion
Vanderbilt project.
Recital and Recital Committee (Blair)
Blair: For recitals given for credit, the recital committee is the same as the hearing committee whenever possible.
The final grade is a composite of those of at least two committee members, including the studio instructor, with the
studio instructor’s grade valued at two thirds of the total. Copies of committee member’s grades are kept by the
instructor. Recitals not given for credit are not graded; they involve a hearing committee but not a recital
committee.
Recital Attendance (Blair)
Blair: Each semester in residence, students (except graduating seniors in their penultimate or final semester) are
required to register for MUSO 1000 and attend weekly student recitals/convocations and a minimum of six Blair
faculty or professional concerts or their community equivalents as described on the syllabus. Students must fulfill
both aspects of the requirement to pass each semester. The course receives zero credit hours but is graded on a
Pass/Fail basis and listed on students’ transcripts. A temporary final grade will not be granted except in the case of
documented medical emergency.
 
Students must register their attendance at each recital. Two absences from Friday afternoon recitals are permitted
each semester. Under extraordinary circumstances, make-up assignments can be obtained from the recital
attendance coordinator with the permission of the associate dean. Students must plan and keep up with their
concert attendance. Except for weekly student recitals, performances in which students are participants do not fulfill
the attendance requirement for the performer. Deadline for completion of all work is listed on the course syllabus for
MUSO 1000. The first failure would result in the loss of the senior penultimate or final semester exemption.
Additional failure(s) would require students to enroll for additional semester(s) until the seven required semesters
are passed.
Extracurricular Performance (Blair)
Blair: Students must be in good standing and have the consent of their private instructors in order to participate in
any extracurricular performance activities, including in-school collaboration, that are not required by a student’s
degree program or honor scholarship.

“The work of the College of Arts and Science is fundamental. It is the basis of all professional study. No professional
school can be self-sufficient. The College in its undergraduate and graduate work must remain the heart of the whole
situation, and send its quickening life blood into every fiber and tissue.”
—Chancellor James H. Kirkland at the semicentennial celebration of the university October 1925
 
Chancellor Kirkland’s words were prophetic of our times as well as true of his own. Since its founding Vanderbilt has
pursued its mission of excellence in the liberal arts with a commitment to liberal learning that is the special concern
of the College of Arts and Science. Liberal learning endures because it brings men and women to subjects, concepts,
and modes of thought that enable them to think critically about where humanity has been and where it ought to be
going. The liberal arts spark curiosity and broaden vision, help to instill understanding of matters otherwise
unknown, and encourage individuals to live their lives with a sense of purpose, context, and relatedness. A liberal
education has perennial relevance and usefulness: it should prepare its recipients to think precisely, to reason
clearly, and to judge wisely—all practical considerations in the pursuit of constructive and satisfying lives and in the
practice of today’s professions and vocations.
 
Today the College of Arts and Science maintains its historic position as the heart of the university. Excellence in
undergraduate and graduate education is its unwavering aim.
 
The College of Arts and Science provides intellectual stimulation, training, and incentive designed to foster the
lifelong liberal learning of its graduates. It offers challenging, forward-looking programs of study in the humanities,
natural sciences, and social sciences resourcefully taught by distinguished faculty recognized for excellence in
research, scholarship, and creative expression. It promotes self-realization and expression in the context of social
responsibility.
 
Faculty and Students
The College of Arts and Science derives its strength from the range of its academic offerings, from the quality of the
faculty who teach, and from the quality of the students who come to learn. Traditionally fortunate in its ability to
attract and retain a superior faculty, the College of Arts and Science has more than 500 full-time professors who
supplement their achievements in the classroom with significant research, creativity, and writing. Many faculty
members hold awards for distinguished scholarship and have been elected to high offices in their professional
associations, including the Classical Association of the Middle West and South, the American Economics Association,
the American Political Science Association, the American Philosophical Association, the American Physical Society,
Page 99 of 1019 

the American Historical Association, and the Biophysical Society.
 
The quality of the College’s faculty is matched by that of its diverse student body. Undergraduates come from the
fifty states and fifteen to twenty foreign countries and are almost evenly divided between men and women.
 
Academic Support
The Writing Studio / Tutoring Services
The Writing Studio provides undergraduate students the opportunity to meet with trained writing consultants to
discuss individual writing concerns, from invention to drafting to revision. The Writing Studio provides a space for
students to discuss work-in-progress with expert writers, to create their own writing, and to utilize available
resources for improving both writing and critical thinking skills.
 
The mission of the Vanderbilt Writing Studio is to enhance student writing and writing instruction, and to encourage
regular conversation about the writing process. The Writing Studio’s extensive programming includes individual
consultations, creative writing groups, workshops focused on specific issues in academic writing, open- mike
readings, and student-run writers’ support groups.
 
The Writing Studio is located at 1801 Edgehill Avenue, Suite 112, and there is a satellite location in 217 Commons
Center convenient to the first-year residence halls. The Writing Studio website can be accessed at
 
One-on-one tutoring in many subjects is available through Tutoring Services, also located at 1801 Edgehill Avenue.
Consultations in the Writing Studio and in Tutoring Services are free to all undergraduates.
 
Computers
The following locations are available for walk-in use of computers and software:
 
Center for Second Language Studies (Furman Hall 001)
Stevenson computer lab and lounge (Stevenson Center 2200)
Wilson computer lab (Wilson Hall 120)
 
All of the college’s computer labs and classrooms offer a wide variety of “courseware” and commercial “productivity
software,” including word processing packages. Color printing and scanners are available in most of the labs. In
addition to accessing software on the local servers, students may also connect to both campus services and the
internet, including VUGmail and e-resources in the libraries, as well as course materials in Brightspace. While use of
the above facilities is free, printing is charged per page.
 
The computer classrooms in the Center for Second Language Studies and Wilson Hall are available for walk-in use
during the late afternoon and evening hours. Stevenson Center lab and lounge are card-accessible weeknights until
1:00
a.m. All lab hours are posted by semester at In addition to the college facilities, a few “kiosk” systems are available
in the Sarratt Student Center. As a result, access to computers in the College of Arts and Science is extensive.
 
Page 100 of 1019 

At last count, more than 98 percent of Vanderbilt students own a personal computer. Since all students also have a
high-speed network connection, it is convenient for students to have their own system (please consult the ResNet
guidelines for supported systems). However, most students will find that the college computing facilities provide all
of the computing resources that are needed for success at Vanderbilt.
 
The Advising System
Entering first-year students are assigned advisers from CASPAR (College of Arts and Science Pre-major Academic
Advising Resources Center). These “pre-major advisers” counsel students during their first three and one-half
semesters, or until the students choose majors, when they are assigned faculty advisers in their major department
or program. Pre-major advisers are specially trained to help students move efficiently through the requirements of
AXLE (Achieving eXcellence in Liberal Education) and chart a course of study.
 
During the last two years of study, when a student is acquiring depth of knowledge in a major field, studies are
guided by a specialist in that field. Students are encouraged to see their faculty advisers at any time, since the
advisers are available for guidance and counseling and are faculty members with whom advisees may be studying.
 
All students are required to see their advisers prior to registration for each semester.
 
Advisers are generally happy to talk over any problems students may have, although their chief function is  
academic counseling. In addition, several members of the Dean’s Office of Undergraduate Education, themselves
teaching faculty members, have as their principal duty counseling students and referring them to sources of
expertise on non-academic problems.
 
Public Lectures
THE BERRY LECTURES. Established in 1988 through the generosity of Kendall and Allen Berry, John and Shirley
Lachs, Steve Turner, and Jim Burke. Three annual lectures—the Berry lecture, the Steve Turner lecture, and the Jim
Burke lecture—are given by distinguished philosophers.
 
THE LOUIS JACOB BIRCHER LECTURE IN CHEMISTRY. Established in 1976 in recognition of Professor Bircher’s forty-
one years of service to Vanderbilt beginning in 1921. He served as the sole professor of physical chemistry until
1954, was chair of the Department of Chemistry from 1955 to 1961, and retired as professor emeritus in 1962.

THE CARL K. SEYFERT LECTURE IN ASTRONOMY. Established in 1983 as part of the astronomy program’s
commemoration of the thirtieth anniversary of the Arthur J. Dyer Observatory. The lectureship recognizes the
untiring efforts and contributions to astronomy made by Carl K. Seyfert, professor of astronomy and first director of
the Dyer Observatory. A distinguished astronomer is invited to present this lecture every third year.
 
THE SHANKS LECTURES. Established in 1984 and named for E. Baylis Shanks and Olivia H. Shanks in honor of their
accomplishments in the fields of mathematics and education and in recognition of their loyalty and service to
Vanderbilt University, these lectures are presented on two successive days in the fall of each year. A special
committee from the Department of Mathematics, influenced by the professional interests of Professor and Mrs.
Shanks, chooses the lecturers from mathematicians of the highest reputation. The topics of the lectureship vary
from year to year according to the area of specialization of the speaker chosen. The lectures have been endowed by
members of the family of Olivia and Baylis Shanks.
 
THE FRANCIS G. SLACK LECTURES IN PHYSICS. Established in 1977 by the Department of Physics and Astronomy in
honor of Francis G. Slack, former Landon C. Garland professor of physics and chair of the department, these lectures
recognize his many contributions to physics. The series was first partially endowed by his colleagues and students
and then with the generous help of Professor Slack. Each speaker gives one lecture of general interest to the
university and one more specialized lecture for the department.
 
THE DAVID STEINE LECTURE. Established in 1978 as a memorial to David Steine, professor of business
administration in the Department of Economics and Business Administration, by members of his family, friends, and
associates. The lecture is devoted to an economic problem of interest to the general public.
 
THE GERTRUDE VANDERBILT AND HAROLD S. VANDERBILT VISITING WRITERS PROGRAM. Established in the
Department of
English in 1958 under the generous sponsorship of the late Mrs. Vanderbilt, this program has annually presented

Limitation on Credit Hours outside the College
Candidates for the bachelor of arts degree must successfully complete a minimum of 102 credit hours within the
College of Arts and Science. Students who are completing an approved second major from one of the other schools
within Vanderbilt are required to complete 90 credit hours within the College of Arts and Science for the bachelor of
arts degree.

AXLE: Achieving eXcellence in Liberal Education
The Arts and Science core program of study—known as AXLE—is anchored in intensive practice in writing and a
diverse thirteen-course component of classes that has been designed to allow maximum choice in course selection
(based on student interests and achievement levels). At the same time, the distribution requirements of AXLE
ensure that students will explore intellectually and academically the breadth of possibilities represented by the
liberal arts.
 
What Is Liberal Education?
The study of the liberal arts—what is historically called a liberal education—is the oldest and most venerable form of
higher education. It has proved itself perennially flexible and adaptive over the past centuries, and it remains the
single best educational preparation for further, specialized study in the professions (medicine, law, education,
business, et al.), as well as for doctoral work in the humanities and social sciences and advanced research in the
sciences. The holistic focus of a liberal education encompasses all areas of human knowledge: the natural and social
sciences, mathematics, foreign languages and cultures, the arts, and the humanities. The empirical disciplines guide
us in our efforts to live most productively and efficiently. But the rest of the curriculum—the humanities and the arts
—makes it possible to reflect upon the right use of the remarkable scientific knowledge we have acquired. In a
liberal arts education, content is always considered in its larger context. Thus, the reflective and discursive aspects
of study in the liberal arts call upon students to move beyond the mere acquisition of information to inquire into the
deeper issues within their studies, and to connect their learning across disciplines and cultures as they live and work
in the communal environment of Vanderbilt. The end product of a successful liberal arts education is a thoughtful
citizen who is prepared to take up his or her rights and responsibilities in a democratic society, to analyze and
critique received information, to articulate the issues at hand or the personal values at stake, and whose intellectual
life is marked by ongoing internal dialogue about the quality and meaning of life for him or her, as well as for the
community at large.
 
Fear No Learning!
The interdisciplinary inclination of many courses in the College of Arts and Science is an ideal training ground for
learning new methodologies for problem solving in the complex, global world of the 21st century. Here, students
may work with biologists and psychologists in the Neuroscience program; study with creative writers, sociologists,
historians, or cinema and media arts scholars in the African American and Diaspora Studies program; or take a class,
team taught, by professors from the School of Music and the Department of English in the College of Arts and
Science. Over the course of a Vanderbilt education, students challenge themselves with the academic demands of
the classes  they select, and are challenged by new ideas and unfamiliar ways of looking at issues. Exploring beyond
the boundaries of one’s intellectual comfort zone in order to admit new ideas is one of the most important aspects of
higher education. The time and effort devoted to selecting thoughtfully the courses that will satisfy AXLE
requirements prepare students for the more specialized study that they undertake in their major (or majors).
 
How to Get Started
The program of studies is divided approximately into thirds:
 
1/3 — courses to meet the requirements of the Writing and Liberal Arts requirements;
1/3 — courses required to complete the chosen major;
1/3 — electives, which will complete the 120 credit hours required for graduation.
 
These divisions are approximate and may differ for individual students.
 
For a student’s first semester, most selections should be from the first group, courses that will fulfill the Writing and
Page 104 of 1019 

Liberal Arts requirements. Academic background, career goals, and general talents and interests will affect choice of
courses.
 
Upon graduation, students in the College of Arts and Science will receive a bachelor of arts degree upon completion
of the other four requirements in addition to AXLE: fulfillment of requirements for one major, a 2.000 average in the
major, 120 cumulative earned credit hours, and a 2.000 average overall.
 
Where to Get Information
In addition to this catalog’s sections on the rules, regulations, and policies of the College of Arts and Science as well
as descriptions of the academic programs of all the undergraduate schools, students may refer to the booklet,
Understanding Your Core Curriculum & Pre-major Advising, a College of Arts and Science manual for entering
students.
 
Where to Get Advice
Entering students are assigned pre-major advisers from CASPAR (College of Arts and Science Pre-major Academic
Advising Resources Center). Pre-major advisers are carefully selected and receive intensive training on how to help
students proceed effectively through the requirements of AXLE and chart a course of study. These advisers will
counsel students through their first three and one-half semesters or until they declare a major. At that time,
students are assigned faculty advisers in their major departments. Students are encouraged to see their advisers at
any time; they must, however, consult their pre-major adviser three times during the first year: during summer
before the fall semester, prior to the opening of enrollment windows for the spring semester, and prior to the
opening of enrollment windows for the fall semester of their second year. Prior to their first semester, entering first-
year students must consult in June with their pre-major adviser who will assist with course selections for registration
for the fall and begin to understand each student’s interests and goals. (This initial contact is typically via phone
and/or email.)
 
What Is AXLE?
AXLE is the acronym for Achieving eXcellence in Liberal Education. It is the core curriculum that all students in the
College of Arts and Science must fulfill. The AXLE curriculum is flexible and very user-friendly. It consists of two
parts: the Writing Requirement and the Liberal Arts Requirement.
The Writing Requirement has four segments: completion of English 1100 or demonstration of basic skills in English
composition; completion of a First-Year Writing Seminar; completion of a writing course (indicated by a “W”) no later
than the fourth semester in residence; and completion of a second writing course (indicated by a “W”) or an
approved course in oral communication (CMST 2100, 2110, or 2120).
The Liberal Arts Requirement is composed of a total of thirteen courses taken at Vanderbilt, and distributed across
six categories. The First-Year Writing Seminar and all writing courses, and approved Oral Communication courses
are also counted in the thirteen-course Liberal Arts Requirement.
1. The Writing Requirement (three to four courses)
a. English Composition ENGL 1100 (appropriate test score or one course)
b. First-Year Writing Seminar (one course)
c. a W course before the end of the fourth semester (one course)
d. a second W course or approved Oral Communication course (one course)
2. The Liberal Arts Requirement (13 courses)
a. HCA — Humanities and the Creative Arts (three courses)
b. INT — International Cultures (three courses)
c. US — History and Culture of the United States (one course)
d. MNS — Mathematics and Natural Sciences (three courses)
e. SBS — Social and Behavioral Sciences (two courses)
f. P — Perspectives (one course)
All students must also complete requirements for at least one major (between 27 and 48 credit hours of course
Page 105 of 1019 

work) and earn a minimum number of 120 earned credit hours in order to graduate.
 
Overview of AXLE
AXLE consists of two parts: the Writing Requirement (including a First-Year Writing Seminar) and the Liberal Arts
Requirement.
 
The First-Year Writing Seminar
The First-Year Writing Seminar is an integral part of the first-year experience in the College of Arts and Science.
Through these seminars, first-year students engage in independent learning and inquiry in an environment in which
they can express knowledge and defend opinions through intensive class discussion, oral presentations, and written
expression. The small-group nature of these seminars allows for direct student-faculty interaction that stresses
training in techniques of scholarly inquiry. The students’ written work and oral presentations are subject to
thoughtful critical review by the faculty member, providing feedback that can be used to reconsider the manner in
which they articulate their ideas and to refine their skills in these areas. Thus, first-year students learn not only
about the subject matter of the seminar, but are also exposed to new methods of acquiring knowledge, different
ways of expressing and sharing ideas, and unique opportunities to participate in critical inquiry.
 
All first-year students must enroll in a First-Year Writing Seminar. (First-Year Writing Seminars in the College of Arts
and Science are numbered 1111.) This course may be taken during the fall or the spring semester. Students are
permitted to enroll in only one First-Year Writing Seminar per semester. All First-Year Writing Seminars also count in
their appropriate distribution areas within the Liberal Arts Requirement, but a second seminar will not count toward
the writing requirement. Students who transfer into the College of Arts and Science (whether from another school at
Vanderbilt or from another college or university) do not complete a First-Year Writing Seminar. Students beyond
their second semester in residence may not register for First-Year Writing Seminars, nor may First- Year Writing
Seminars be repeated after completion of the second semester in residence.
 
The Writing Requirement
Excellent communication skills, including the ability to articulate ideas and defend positions in writing, will be
paramount for the 21st-century graduates of Vanderbilt University; therefore, all students in the College of Arts and
Science must successfully complete the Writing Requirement.
a. All students must demonstrate competence in English composition. Appropriate skills in composition are
essential to successful progress at the Competence is demonstrated by completion of ENGL 1100 or any of
the following test-based or transfer-credit satisfiers:
i. SAT: Combined score of at least 1220 on the Writing and Critical Reasoning sections, with a minimum
score of 500 on each (test taken prior to March 2016).
ii. SAT: Score of at least 660 on the Evidence-Based Reading and Writing section.
iii. ACT: Score of at least 30 on the English portion (beginning October 2016).
iv. AP: Minimum score of 4 on the English Language or English Literature exam.
v. IB: Minimum score of 6 on the Higher level English
vi. Transfer credit for English 1100
vii. Transfer credit for English 1210W, 1220W, 1230W, 1250W, 1260W, 1270W, or 1300W. (If used to
satisfy the English composition requirement, the transfer credit does NOT also count as the W course
required to achieve junior standing.
b. First-Year Writing Seminar (see above). 
c. All students must successfully complete at least one Arts and Science writing course (indicated by a “W”) at
Vanderbilt University, regardless of AP or IB credits, SAT scores, or ACT scores earned prior to matriculation.
The 1000-level writing-intensive courses emphasize general writing skills within the context of discipline-
specific subject matter. The 2000 and higher-level writing-intensive courses foster advanced, discipline-
specific writing skills. Departments or programs that offer these courses determine their specific writing In
2000 or higher-level W courses, continued attention to the process of writing is included in the classroom.
Students receive regular feedback on their writing that will contribute toward enhancing writing skills
appropriate to specific disciplines. The process of revising written work allows students to reflect on the
writing process; writing tutorials may also be included. All students are required to complete a W course
Page 106 of 1019 

(other than ENGL 1100 or a First-Year Writing Seminar) no later than the fourth semester. All Arts and
Science W courses also count in their appropriate distribution areas within the Liberal Arts Requirement.
d. All students must successfully complete either a second Arts and Science W course (other than ENGL 1100 or
a First-Year Writing Seminar), or an approved course in oral communication (CMST 2100, 2110, 2120) at
Vanderbilt University, regardless of AP or IB credits, SAT scores, or ACT scores earned prior to Oral
communication courses focus on developing improved public speaking skills. These courses introduce
students to the principles and practices of public discourse and reasoned argument. Attention to the process
of effective oral communication is integral to these classes. Students receive regular speaking assignments
throughout the semester and regular feedback to enhance effective speaking skills. All students must
complete Part d of the Writing Requirement before graduation.
The Liberal Arts Requirement
The Liberal Arts Requirement consists of successful completion of thirteen courses from the College of Arts and
Science. Most courses in the College of Arts and Science fulfill one of these Liberal Arts requirements. Courses must
carry three or more credits to count toward the AXLE Liberal Arts Requirement. Although some courses may be
appropriate to more than one requirement, each course will fulfill only one requirement. These thirteen courses
must be distributed as outlined below. They must be taken from at least seven departments or subject areas.
 
a. Humanities and the Creative Arts — HCA (3 courses)
Courses in the humanities and the creative arts challenge students to examine their personal understanding of life
and how their individual experiences overlap with those of the rest of humankind. These courses testify to the
varying ways in which people think, form values, confront ambiguity, express spiritual and aesthetic yearnings, and
grapple with moral and ethical problems. By analyzing and interpreting literary, philosophical, religious, or artistic
works, students examine the foundations of human experience. By producing original artistic works in imaginative
writing, studio art, theatre, film, music, and dance, students have the opportunity to connect the universal sources
of human inspiration with their own creative processes.
 
b. International Cultures — INT (3 courses)
The study of international cultures provides students with a basis for understanding the diversity of experiences and
values in our contemporary, global society. Options in this category include not only international history and
cultural studies courses, but also courses in literature, cinema and media arts, the social sciences, art, music, and
languages. Students may satisfy this requirement by choosing courses that focus on the history and culture of a
single society or time period in human history and/or that represent a broad spectrum of different human societies
and time periods.
Language courses introduce students to the language of a different culture and provide insight into that culture in
ways that are not possible to achieve through detached study. At intermediate and advanced levels, students are
able to explore the culture in depth, using the language itself to read, discuss, and write about its various aspects.
Even at the most basic level, exposure to the language of a different culture prepares students to think and act in
terms of living in a global community.
 
Intermediate and advanced language courses prepare students for study abroad programs, which the College of
Arts and Science strongly recommends. A maximum of one course in this requirement may be satisfied through
study abroad in a Vanderbilt-approved program. A summer study abroad program must earn 6 or more credit hours
to satisfy this requirement.
 
The Global Education Office maintains a list of pre-approved programs.
 
Note: All students who study abroad must register their travel in advance with Vanderbilt’s international security
provider. Registration is completed on your behalf if you enroll in a program offered through the Global Education
Office. Otherwise, information is available on the GlobalVU website: vanderbilt.edu/global.
 
Page 107 of 1019 

All students must complete three courses in this category, irrespective of previous language study or proficiency in  
a language other than English. At least one of the three courses presented in fulfillment of this category must be a
second-semester (or higher) language acquisition class taught at Vanderbilt University (or through the Duke–UVa–
Vanderbilt Partnership for Less Commonly Taught Languages), unless the student successfully demonstrates 
proficiency in a language other than English at or above the level achieved by second-semester language
acquisition classes taught at Vanderbilt University. Students may demonstrate proficiency in a number of ways: SAT
Subject Test scores (French, 540; German, 470; Hebrew, 530; Italian, 540; Japanese with Listening, 440; Latin, 530;
Spanish, 520); by appropriate score on proficiency tests (written and oral) administered by the Tennessee Language
Center; or with AP or IB credit in a foreign language. The first semester of an introductory language acquisition class
in any language a student has studied for at least two years in high school, or in which a student transfers credit
from another institution, cannot be used in partial fulfillment of this requirement. Intensive elementary language
courses that cover the content of two semesters in one shall count as one course toward this category.
 
Students who, because of special ability and achievement, are admitted to the College of Arts and Science without
the normally required two years of one foreign language in high school must enroll in a foreign language course
during their first semester and must remain continuously enrolled until they successfully complete a full year of one
foreign language. They must complete this requirement by the end of their fourth semester in the College of Arts
and Science.
 
c. History and Culture of the United States — US (1 course)
The study of the history and culture of the United States provides students with a basis for understanding the
American experience and the shaping of American values and viewpoints within the context of an increasingly global
society. Interpreting history and culture in the broadest sense, options in this category include traditional history and
cultural studies courses, but also courses in literature, cinema and media arts, the social sciences, art, and music,
which illuminate historical periods or cultural themes in United States history. Students may satisfy this requirement
by choosing a course that focuses on the history and culture of a single social group or time period in American
history and/or that represents a broad spectrum of different social groups and time periods.
 
d. Mathematics and Natural Sciences — MNS (3 courses, one of which must be a laboratory science)
Courses in mathematics emphasize quantitative reasoning and prepare students to describe, manipulate, and
evaluate complex or abstract ideas or arguments with precision. Skills in mathematical and quantitative reasoning
provide essential foundations for the study of natural and social sciences. Students are generally introduced to
mathematical reasoning through the study of introductory courses in calculus or probability and statistics.
 
Courses in the natural sciences engage students in hypothesis-driven quantitative reasoning that helps to explain
natural phenomena, the roles of testing and replication of experimental results, and the processes through which
scientific hypotheses and theories are developed, modified, or abandoned in the face of more complete evidence, or
integrated into more general conceptual structures. Laboratory science courses engage students in methods of
experimental testing of hypotheses and analysis of data that are the hallmarks of the natural sciences. Natural
science courses prepare students to understand the complex interactions between science, technology, and society;
teach students to apply scientific principles to everyday experience; and develop the capacity to distinguish
between science and what masquerades as science.
 
e. Social and Behavioral Sciences — SBS (2 courses)
Social scientists endeavor to study human behavior at the levels of individuals, their interactions with others, their
societal structures, and their social institutions. The remarkable scope represented by these disciplines extends
from studying the underpinnings of brain function to the dynamics of human social groups to the structures of
political and economic institutions. The methods employed by social scientists are correspondingly broad, involving
approaches as varied as mapping brain activity, discovering and charting ancient cultures, identifying the societal
forces that shape individual and group behavior, and using mathematics to understand economic phenomena. By
studying how humans and societies function, students will learn about individual and societal diversity, growth, and
change.
Page 108 of 1019 

 
f. Perspectives — P (1 course)
Courses in Perspectives give significant attention to individual and cultural diversity, multicultural interactions,
sexual orientation, gender, racial, ethical, and religious issues within a culture across time or between cultures,
thereby extending the principles and methods associated with the liberal arts to the broader circumstances in which
students live. These courses emphasize the relationship of divergent ethics and moral values to contemporary social
issues and global conflicts. 
 
The Major
All students must successfully complete a course of study leading to one of the approved major programs in the
College of Arts and Science, or successfully complete an individually designed interdisciplinary major designed in
consultation with College of Arts and Science faculty and approved by the Committee on Individual Programs in the
College of Arts and Science.
 
AXLE Curriculum Course Distribution
The distribution of Arts and Science courses into AXLE categories is available in YES. Using the advanced-class-
search dialog box, use the pull-down menu under “Class Attributes” to select an AXLE category.
 
AXLE, the Major, and the Optional Minor
Courses used to satisfy requirements of AXLE may also be used to satisfy requirements of the major or the optional
minor.
 
Advanced Placement under AXLE
With the exception of basic English composition and the foreign language proficiency requirements, no AXLE
requirement may be fulfilled with any form of advanced placement credit (AP, IB, A-level, etc.).
 
Transfer Credit under AXLE
Generally, only courses taken in the College of Arts and Science may be used toward AXLE; however, any college
course credit earned prior to graduation from high school, and transfer credit earned before admission to
Vanderbilt, may be used toward fulfilling AXLE requirements.
 
Area of Concentration
During the junior and senior years, much of the student’s work is concentrated in one large unit of intellectually
related courses. The program of concentration may be arranged through a single major, an interdisciplinary major,
or a double major. Each of the three options is described below. A triple major may be declared with the approval of
the Administrative Committee.
 
Major Field
Under this plan, the student majors in one of the recognized fields. There shall not be fewer than 27 credit hours in
the major field, but a given department may require up to 48 credit hours. Students may take more than the
required number of credit hours in any major; any given department, however, may limit the total permissible credit
Page 109 of 1019 

hours in a discipline.
 
For graduation, a student must have achieved a grade point average of at least 2.000 in all classes taken in the 
major. This set of courses includes all courses a student takes in the department or program of the major and all
courses a student takes outside the department or program that may count toward the major. All courses that are
listed as fulfilling credit hours required for the major, as listed in the Undergraduate Catalog, are included in
calculating the grade point average in the major.
 
Within the framework of these general requirements, each department has its own policies governing major work,
which are published elsewhere in this catalog or otherwise available to students.
 
Academic programs of the College of Arts and Science are varied and broad in scope, with departmental majors
offered in the following fields:
 
African American and Diaspora Studies
History
Anthropology
History of Art and Architecture
Architecture and the Built Environment
Jewish Studies
Art
Law, History, and Society
Asian Studies
Mathematics
Biological Sciences
Medicine, Health, and Society
Chemistry
Molecular and Cellular Biology
Cinema and Media Arts
Philosophy
Communication Studies
Physics
Earth and Environmental Sciences
Political Science
Ecology, Evolution, and Organismal Biology
Psychology
Economics
Religious Studies
English
Russian Studies
Environmental Sociology
Sociology
French
Spanish
Gender and Sexuality Studies
Spanish and Portuguese
German Studies
Theatre
 
Defined Interdisciplinary Programs
Students may also major in defined interdisciplinary programs (listed below). There shall not be fewer than 27 credit
hours in the major field, but a given program may require up to 48 credit hours. The student must achieve at least a
2.000 grade point average in all work taken in the major.
 
American Studies
German and European Studies
Biochemistry and Chemical Biology
Italian and European Studies
Classical and Mediterranean Studies

Page 110 of 1019 

 
Students may combine an interdisciplinary major with a major in one of the recognized fields listed at the beginning
of this section.
 
Declaration of the Area of Concentration
Students may formally declare a major at any time during the third semester of residence and must do so no later
than the Friday before Spring Break of the fourth semester. The student selects a department or interdisciplinary
program and contacts that department or program for assignment to an adviser. Students who wish to develop an
individually designed interdisciplinary program apply to the associate dean who chairs the Committee on Individual
Programs.
 
Each fall a program is arranged that provides for consultation of sophomores with department chairs, for the
purpose of helping students select a major. Sophomore students who have not declared a major should participate
in this program if they intend to attain junior standing before the next spring.
 
Students should declare their intention to pursue specific majors by completing forms available in the Dean’s Office
of Undergraduate Education as well as the various departmental and program offices. Departments and programs
assign advisers to students who declare majors in their respective areas. Students have the responsibility to know
and satisfy all requirements for majors that they intend to complete. When the student’s major has been registered,
access to the student’s academic record is transferred from the pre-major adviser to the new major adviser, with
whom they should work closely.
 
Students may not add a major(s) past the fifth class-day of the first semester of the senior year.
 
Individually Designed Interdisciplinary Majors
This plan permits students to contract for an individually designed program of concentration consisting of at least
48 credit hours of approved work. The program is constructed around a coherent academic purpose and may draw
together the academic resources of a number of departments and schools. The program’s purpose may include
topical, period, or area studies, and must be consistent with the philosophy underlying a liberal arts education (see
the “What is Liberal Education?” section of this catalog). The program should not be designed with a focus on pre-
professional training  (e.g., pre-business, pre-law, or pre-medicine). The student may be required to achieve a
standard of proficiency in appropriately related areas such as foreign languages or mathematics in addition to the
48 credit hours constituting the program of concentration.
 
Each student must identify a major adviser who will offer advice and guidance. The major adviser must be a
professor or full-time senior lecturer in the College of Arts and Science.
 
The student’s plan for an individually designed interdisciplinary major is a statement of required courses.
Furthermore, because of the nature of interdisciplinary majors, all courses that have previously been included in the
student’s plan are considered to be part of the major discipline. The student must achieve at least a 2.000 grade
point average in all courses that are (or have been) part of the plan.
 
Normally, no more than three introductory-level courses will be counted toward the interdisciplinary major.
 
Students may not add a major(s) past the fifth class day of the first semester of the senior year.
Page 111 of 1019 

 
Double and Triple Majors
This program permits a student to concentrate in two or three fields, which may or may not be intellectually related.
With approval of the departments concerned, the student completes all of the requirements stipulated for the
majors. Triple majors require approval of the Administrative Committee.
 
Each A&S major must include at least 24 credit hours that are being counted solely toward the major. This rule also
applies to students who combine (in a double or triple major) a non-interdisciplinary major with an interdisciplinary
major.
Students in the School of Engineering may use courses taken in the College of Arts & Science for relevant second
majors even if those courses also fulfill a School of Engineering degree requirement.
Approved Second Majors Outside the College
All undergraduate courses, majors, and minors offered by Blair School of Music, School of Engineering, and Peabody
College are approved for students in the College of Arts and Science. See the appropriate sections of the
Undergraduate Catalog under each school for details. Arts and Science students with a second major from another
Vanderbilt undergraduate school must earn a minimum of 90 credit hours in Arts and Science. Consultation with the
student’s Arts and Science major adviser is especially important.

The Optional Minor
A minor is a program within a recognized area of knowledge offering students more than a casual introduction to the
area but less than a major in it. Although the completion of a minor is not a degree requirement, students may elect
to complete the courses specified for one or more minors. A student who completes all designated courses in a
minor with a grade point average of at least 2.000 will have the minor entered on the transcript at the time of
graduation.
 
Minors may be combined with any departmental major or interdisciplinary major, but minors may not be earned in
the department or program of the major. Each minor must, however, include at least 15 credit hours that are being
counted solely toward the minor. Courses may not be taken on a P/F basis if they are offered in the department of
the minor or if they are being counted toward an interdisciplinary minor (see Academic Regulations).
 
Minors consist of a minimum of five courses of 3 or more credit hours each. Many minors require a greater number
of credit hours and specific courses. When a minor is offered in a discipline that offers a major, only those courses
that count toward the major may be counted toward the minor.
 
Students should refer to the appropriate sections of this catalog for specific requirements. Minors available at
present are listed below.
 
Students should declare their intention to pursue specific minors by completing forms available in the Dean’s Office
of Undergraduate Education as well as the various departmental and program offices. Departments and programs
assign advisers to students who declare minors in their respective areas. Students have the responsibility to know
and satisfy all requirements for minors that they intend to complete.
 
Students may not add or change a minor after the final day of classes in the second semester of their senior year.
 
Optional minors are offered in the following fields and interdisciplinary programs:

Approved Minors Outside the College
Arts and Science students are permitted to pursue a second major and/or a minor that has been approved by the
faculties of the other Vanderbilt undergraduate schools: the Blair School of Music, the School of Engineering, and
Peabody College of Education and Human Development. See the appropriate sections of the Undergraduate Catalog
under each school for details. Minors may not be earned in the department or program of the major.
 
Undergraduate Research
All students have ample opportunity to participate in faculty research projects or to pursue research projects
independently, both on campus and at remote sites. Such research has led to the publication of coauthored or
student-authored papers and other presentations to the scholarly community. Summer and academic year research
by undergraduates in all fields may be subsidized by the university or the College of Arts and Science. Students
should contact the director of undergraduate studies in the field of interest for more information.
 
Study Abroad Programs
Vanderbilt offers study programs for all undergraduate students from Arts and Science, Blair School of Music, School
of Engineering, and Peabody College to provide undergraduates immediate contact with cultures different from their
own and to aid in the mastery of foreign languages. Students interested in applying for study abroad should consult
their advisers to determine whether all degree requirements can be completed on schedule.

Brochures on all approved programs are available in the Global Education Office in Room 115, Student Life Center.
GEO also maintains a website, vanderbilt.edu/geo. The study abroad programs are described in more detail in the
Special Programs for Undergraduates section of this catalog.
 
When choosing programs in a city for study abroad, College of Arts and Science students may only apply to the
Vanderbilt-approved overseas program(s). The College only accepts credit from international schools and programs
that have been approved by Vanderbilt faculty, and for which the University has a contract or agreement.

Students interested in the study of medicine should plan their undergraduate programs in consultation with Dr.
Michelle Grundy, health professions adviser. There is no formal premedical program of courses in the College of Arts
and Science or elsewhere at Vanderbilt. Each student should plan a program to meet individual needs. The program
should include whatever courses may be necessary to meet medical school admission requirements, all courses
required for the major, all AXLE requirements, and elective options. Students may choose majors from any of the
four undergraduate colleges, and may elect to pursue a double major or an interdisciplinary program of
concentration.
 
A student who plans to apply for admission to the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, as well as other medical
schools, may choose either of the following options:
 
1. A student may qualify for admission with a B.A. degree, whether completed in three years or in four. Minimum
requirements for admission generally would be met by completing at least two semesters of English, four semesters
of chemistry including organic, two semesters of biology, two semesters of physics, and at least one semester of
calculus/math. Since prerequisites may vary across medical schools, students are urged to consult the online
resource, Medical School Admission Requirements (MSAR) published by the American Association of Medical Schools
(at aamc.org) for school-specific information.
 
In light of the Medical College Admissions Test (MCAT) changes that took effect in 2015, it is recommended that
students take one semester of biochemistry and one semester of introductory statistics. Additionally, through course
work or self-directed study, students will need to be knowledgeable in basic concepts of psychology, sociology, and
bioethics.
 
For more information, students are advised to visit the website of the Health Professions Advisory Office
(vanderbilt.edu/hpao) and refer to the links for 1) “Premedical Preparation” and 2) “Threading a path through
premedical expectations.”
 
2. A student may qualify as a three-year student in the senior-in-absentia program (see Senior-in-Absentia in this
catalog).
 
Dentistry
Students interested in predental studies should plan their undergraduate program in consultation with Dr. Michelle
Grundy, health professions adviser. There is no formal predental program of courses at Vanderbilt. Predental studies
should include courses necessary to meet dental school admission requirements, all courses required for the major,
all AXLE requirements, and elective options. Students may choose majors from any of the four undergraduate
colleges. They may also elect a double major or an interdisciplinary program of concentration. A student may apply
Page 115 of 1019 

to dental school under the senior-in-absentia program (see Senior-in-Absentia in this catalog) or apply for admission
after three years of college work without a degree.
 
Any student contemplating application to dental school should take at least two semesters of English, four
semesters of chemistry including organic, two semesters of biology, two semesters of physics, and at least one
semester of calculus/math. Since prerequisites may vary across dental schools, students are urged to consult the
ADEA Official Guide to Dental Schools published by the American Association of Dental Schools.
 
Nursing
Students interested in developing a program that could lead to a master of science in nursing are advised to consult
the Office of Admissions in the School of Nursing.
 
Architecture
Undergraduate students in the College of Arts and Science expecting to pursue architecture at the graduate level
should complete at least one year of analytic geometry and calculus and one year of physics. Students may select
any major  but would want to include courses that emphasize a broad sense of art and architectural history,
including courses in studio art. Before applying to specific schools of architecture, they would develop a portfolio of
creative work. Further information is available from the pre-architecture advisers: Professor Vesna Pavlović,
Department of Art, and Professor Kevin Murphy, Department of the History of Art and Architecture.
 
Engineering
Undergraduate students in the College of Arts and Science expecting to pursue engineering at the graduate level
should normally major in a natural science or mathematics and, at a minimum, should complete two years of
calculus or its equivalent, one year each of chemistry and physics, and at least an additional year of a natural
science or mathematics. A minimum of one year of computer science is highly desirable. Students should seek
specific information concerning admission from the engineering school of their choice as early as possible,
preferably by the end of the sophomore year, to assure optimum preparation for entry into that school. Standards
for admission vary, but usually a 3.00 average or better is required.
 
Law
There is no formal program of prelaw studies at Vanderbilt. Most law schools have no specific requirements for a
prelaw curriculum but place great emphasis on the development of the student’s ability to read and comprehend
accurately, thoroughly, and rapidly; to speak and write clearly and correctly; to think precisely; and to analyze
complex situations and weigh and appraise their several elements. The development of analytical skills and of
mature study habits is vital. A broad cultural background is important—since law touches life at every point, every
subject in the college curriculum may bear on the lawyer’s work. Students interested in the study of law should plan
their undergraduate programs in consultation with Dean Carrie Russell, prelaw adviser, in the Dean’s Office of
Undergraduate Education.

Internships
Students may earn academic credit for the work of internships in the College of Arts and Science on a Pass/Fail basis
Page 116 of 1019 

through interdisciplinary or departmental internships. Credit hours earned will not count toward major or minor
requirements or toward AXLE, but will count as part of the total credit hours required for graduation. Students obtain
their own placement and faculty adviser who works with them to develop a list of readings or research agenda for
the internship, which must be approved by the director of internships in the College of Arts and Science (Associate
Dean Daniel Morgan). The necessary forms for earning academic credit for an internship may be obtained from the
Dean’s Office of Undergraduate Education in 350 Buttrick Hall, although students register for internships through
their respective school. The deadline for submitting registration forms to the office of Dean Jones for internship
courses taken during summer term and fall semester is May 1. Students expecting to intern during the spring
semester should submit registration forms by January 1.
 
Finding an Internship
Students searching for an internship opportunity locally or elsewhere should contact the Career Center.
 
Interdisciplinary Internships
INDS 3880 (fall, spring), 3884 (summer). 1 credit hour (repeatable)
 
Any student who is at least a sophomore and in good academic standing may earn one credit hour per semester or
summer for an internship under this designation. This course may be repeated twice for a maximum of 3 credit
hours exclusively on a Pass/Fail basis.
 
Departmental Internships
Maximum of 15 credit hours (may be taken only once)
 
Under this option students from any discipline may earn academic credit for internships in the departments listed
below if they meet the minimum GPA requirements and have 6 credit hours of prior work in the department in which
they wish to intern. Students are responsible for securing a faculty adviser for the internship and developing an
academic plan of work for the internship opportunity, both of which must be approved by the director of
undergraduate studies in the department in which the internship is housed. (In some instances, the DUS will serve
as the faculty adviser for all internships taken in that discipline.) All internships under this designation are taken
concurrently with a research and/or readings course. The latter is taken on a graded basis and may count toward
requirements for a major or minor. Students should consult the director of undergraduate studies in the department
of interest to obtain additional information about internships in that discipline. The following departments offer up to
15 credit hours of academic credit per semester or summer for the following courses (internship courses are offered
during FALL, SPRING, and SUMMER sessions):

Cost of an Internship
Internships taken during the fall or spring semester will fall under the normal tuition charge unless the student falls
below 12 or exceeds 18 credit hours during the semester. In both instances, the hourly tuition charge will apply with
permission for an underload/overload from the appropriate academic dean. Students will be charged for internships
taken during summer on the basis of the hourly tuition rate for summer school unless approved in advance to
receive the internship subsidy (see the Career Center website).
 
Combined B.A./M.A. (4+1) Program
The College of Arts and Science offers students in many departments and programs the opportunity to earn both the
bachelor’s degree and the master’s degree in a shorter period of time and at less cost than is normally the case.
 
Exceptional students in the College of Arts and Science can obtain both degrees in an expedited period, typically
within, but not less than, five years.
The usual period of study for both the bachelor’s and the master’s degree is six years. Through the 4+1 option, the
student and her or his adviser plan a five-year program of study. It is important to note that there is no provision for
obtaining both degrees in a period shorter than five years. The program is intended for selected students for whom
the master’s degree is sufficient preparation for their career goals, is desirable as a goal in itself, or is viewed as
additional preparation before pursuing a doctorate or a professional degree.
 
The areas of study available for the Combined B.A./M.A. (4+1) option within Arts and Science are determined by
individual departments and programs, which also determine the policies and guidelines to be followed. Students will
be admitted to the Combined B.A./M.A. program only by the invitation and the approval of the department or
program.
 
Programs of Study
Page 118 of 1019 

The 4+1 option is currently available in the following departments and programs: English; French; German; History;
History of Art and Architecture; Latin American Studies; Mathematics; Medicine, Health, and Society; Philosophy;
Political Science; and Psychology. Students are welcome to discuss the Combined B.A./M.A. (4+1) option with any of
these departments and programs.
 
Admissions Overview
The Combined B.A./M.A program allows Vanderbilt University students to study for both degrees typically, but not
necessarily, in the same department. Undergraduates with strong academic records may apply for admission to the
program after the first semester of their junior year. Qualifying students are normally accepted into the program in
the second semester of the junior year.
 
To apply for admission, students will first consult with the Dean’s Office of Undergraduate Education (350 Buttrick
Hall), and then submit to the prospective graduate department or program a “Petition to Apply to the Combined
B.A./M.A. (4+1) Degree Program” (available at as.vanderbilt.edu/academics/specialdegree/4plus1.php), a statement
of purpose, a formal application to the Graduate School, a preliminary program proposal, two letters of
recommendation from Vanderbilt faculty, and a current transcript. Application forms are available for download or
can be completed online at vanderbilt.edu/gradschool. GRE scores or other admissions requirements may be
specified by the prospective department. Admission to the 4+1 option is highly selective. An accomplished
academic record, a demonstrated commitment to pursue graduate study, and a strong endorsement from
Vanderbilt faculty are key elements to the successful applicant. Students will be provisionally accepted as graduate
students, pending completion of all undergraduate requirements. Graduate student status will apply in the fifth
year.
 
Advising
Prospective students should discuss with one of their advisers general information on the program and whether this
program is appropriate to their long-term goals. All students are encouraged to discuss their plans and goals with
their undergraduate pre-major and major adviser. Especially in cases where the intended graduate program differs
from the undergraduate major, the student is further encouraged to seek advice from the advisers in the graduate
program.
 
Curriculum
Students in a 4+1 program must satisfy all requirements for both degrees. Advanced Placement (AP) credits will
often be used toward satisfying general curriculum requirements, for a maximum of 18 credit hours. The principal
distinction between this program and the standard graduate program is two-fold: (1) students are allowed to take
master’s courses while completing the bachelor’s degree, and (2) students are thereby enabled to complete both
degrees within five years.
 
In order to complete the program in five years, students will be expected to complete most, if not all, of the
requirements for their undergraduate degree by the end of the first semester of the senior year. Until all
baccalaureate requirements are fulfilled, the student will follow College of Arts and Science undergraduate policies
and procedures. It is also suggested that students begin taking graduate courses toward the master’s degree in the
second semester of the senior year. Most graduate programs participating in this option have a non-thesis plan of
study requiring 30 graduate credit hours in addition to the requirements for the undergraduate degree. An average
load per semester as a graduate student is 9–12 credit hours.
 
Scholarships and Financial Aid
Students who are receiving scholarships or other forms of financial aid as a Vanderbilt undergraduate are advised
that such aid applies in most cases only toward the completion of the bachelor’s degree or the first four years of
their studies (which may include their taking some graduate courses during their senior year). Students wishing to
Page 119 of 1019 

pursue the 4+1 option should seek support for their fifth year of study through student loans and other financial aid.

Honors in the College of Arts and Science
Founder's Medal
Latin Honors Designation
College Scholars Program
Departmental Honors
Dean's List
Phi Beta Kappa
Honor Societies for First-Year Students
Other Awards and Prizes
Founder’s Medal
The Founder’s Medal, signifying first honors, was endowed by Commodore Cornelius Vanderbilt as one of his gifts to
the university. The recipient is named by the Dean after consideration of faculty recommendations and overall
academic achievements, as well as grade point averages of the year’s highest ranking summa cum laude graduates.
 
Latin Honors Designation
Honors noted on diplomas and published in the Commencement program are earned as follows:
 
Summa Cum Laude. Students whose grade point average equals or exceeds that of the top 5 percent of the previous
three years’ Arts and Science graduating seniors.
Magna Cum Laude. Students whose grade point average equals or exceeds that of the next 8 percent of the previous
three years’ Arts and Science graduating seniors.
Cum Laude. Students whose grade point average equals or exceeds that of the next 12 percent of the previous three
years’ Arts and Science graduating seniors.
 
College Scholars Program
The College Scholars Program is the honors program for the College of Arts and Science. All first-year students in the
College of Arts & Science are invited to apply at the end of their first semester. Students are selected to participate
in the College Scholars program based on their academic record and achievements from their first semester on
campus. These students have the opportunity to pursue advanced scholarly work in honors seminars and enriched
courses or independent-studies projects. The College Scholars program is open only to Arts and Science students.
 
College Scholars may achieve the designation “Honors in the College of Arts and Science” on their diplomas by
acquiring fifteen “honors points” in the program. The honors points system encourages breadth and depth. Students
accomplish these goals by taking honors seminars in several AXLE categories and by doing independent projects
(independent studies, enriching courses, departmental honors research, internships, service, and creative projects).
A maximum of thirteen points may be earned in honors seminars, and a minimum of two research projects must be
completed to earn fifteen points. Students must earn a grade of “B” or better in classes that earn honors points. To
remain in good standing in the program, students must maintain a minimum grade point average of 3.000.
Page 120 of 1019 

 
Further information on the College Scholars program and honors in the College of Arts and Science may be obtained
from Associate Dean Dan Morgan.
 
Departmental Honors
To encourage individual development and independent study within their field, many departments and
interdisciplinary programs of the College of Arts and Science offer honors programs for selected, superior
candidates. Students often begin departmental honors work in the junior year, but some projects start in the senior
year. To qualify for consideration, students must have (a) attained a minimum grade point average of 3.300 in all
work previously taken for credit and in the major, and (b) exhibited to the department(s) and/or interdisciplinary
program(s) other evidence of the student’s capacity for independent study. Some departments and interdisciplinary
programs require higher grade point averages in all work previously taken for credit and/or in the major. Formal
admission is by the director of honors study in the Dean’s Office of Undergraduate Education after nomination by
the department(s) and/or interdisciplinary program(s) concerned.
 
Requirements to complete departmental honors vary from department to department (see descriptions in the
appropriate department sections of this catalog). Candidates are required to demonstrate some degree of originality
and maturity in the methods of independent investigation, analysis, and criticism, and skill in the written
presentation of independent work. This standard usually requires a senior thesis but may be satisfied, in
departments that have gained approval of this procedure, by a series of briefer critical papers.
 
Departmental honors work culminates in an examination given in the second semester of the senior year. The
examination shall be both oral and written except in departments where honors students must take all courses
required of standard majors in addition to those required of honors students. These departments have the option of
making the examination either oral or both oral and written. The examination shall be conducted by a committee
with a majority of examiners who have not participated in the candidate’s honors work. Where feasible, examiners
from other institutions may be included. The examination shall cover the thesis and specific fields of the
independent work and may, at the discretion of the department, include all of the major work. Successful candidates
are awarded honors or highest honors in their field, and this designation appears on their diplomas.
 
Dean’s List
The Dean’s List recognizes outstanding academic performance in a semester. Students are named to the Dean’s List
when they earn a grade point average of at least 3.500 while carrying 12 or more graded credit hours, with no
temporary or missing grades in any course (credit or non-credit), and no grade of F. A student must be in a degree-
granting school.
 
Phi Beta Kappa
The Alpha Chapter of Phi Beta Kappa in the state of Tennessee honors scholarly attainments in the liberal arts and
sciences and annually elects seniors and juniors to membership during the spring semester.
 
Seniors who have completed at least 60 credit hours in the College of Arts and Science and earned a cumulative
grade point average of 3.65 or higher are eligible for consideration, as are juniors who have completed at least 70
credit hours at Vanderbilt with a cumulative grade point average of at least 3.90. Juniors must have completed most
AXLE requirements by the end of their junior year. For calculating credit hours and judging residence requirements,
the chapter treats foreign study programs in the same manner as does the College of Arts and Science.
 
Attainment of the minimum required grade point average does not guarantee election. Membership in Phi Beta
Kappa is based on a demonstration of scholarly achievements, broad cultural interests, and high moral character.
Page 121 of 1019 

The scholarly work must emphasize liberal rather than applied or professional studies. As a guideline, for seniors at
least 90 credit hours must qualify as liberal. Grades earned in applied (vocational) or professional course work are
not counted in computing the grade point average. The breadth of a candidate’s program, as shown by the number
and variety of courses taken outside the major, is also considered.
 
Phi Beta Kappa has long emphasized the importance of mathematics and foreign language in a liberal education. In
keeping with this tradition, the chapter considers only those students who have demonstrated proficiency in these
areas beyond the AXLE graduation requirements. Proficiency in reading, writing, and speaking a foreign language is
typically demonstrated by passing a course in a language at a level at least one semester beyond the AXLE
requirements. Courses must be taken on a graded rather than a P/F basis. The foreign language requirement may
be satisfied with College Board SAT Subject, Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, or Tennessee
Language Center test scores.
 
Mathematics proficiency may be demonstrated by completing two semesters of calculus or one semester of calculus
and one semester of statistics. Courses must be taken on a graded rather than a P/F basis. The mathematics
requirement may be satisfied with Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, or A-Level exam credit, but
not College Board SAT Subject test scores.
 
In no event may the total number of persons elected from any senior class exceed 10 percent of the class, and from
any junior class exceed six persons. Eligible juniors who are not elected are reconsidered for membership in their
senior year.
 
Refer to the chapter website my.vanderbilt.edu/phibetakappa for additional information and detailed eligibility
criteria.
 
Honor Societies for First-Year Students
First-year students who earn a grade point average of 3.500 or better for their first semester are eligible for
membership in the Vanderbilt chapters of Phi Eta Sigma and Alpha Lambda Delta.

Explanation of Course Numbers and Symbols 1000-level courses are introductory courses primarily taken by
freshmen and sophomores.
 
2000- and higher-level courses are intermediate- or advanced-level courses which typically require some
prerequisite. They are primarily intended for sophomores, juniors, and seniors.
 
Hours are semester hours—e.g., a three-hour course carries credit of three semester hours.
 
Bracketed figures indicate semester hours credit, e.g., [3].
 
First-Year Writing Seminars are numbered 1111.
 
Page 125 of 1019 

W symbols used in course numbers designate courses in the College of Arts and Science that will meet the AXLE
writing requirement.
 
The AXLE designation in parentheses in each course description indicates which AXLE requirement pertains. For
example, (HCA) indicates credit for Humanities and the Creative Arts in AXLE. The designation (No AXLE credit)
indicates the course does not satisfy an AXLE degree requirement.
 
The university reserves the right to change the arrangement or content of courses, to change the texts and other
materials used, or to cancel any course on the basis of insufficient enrollment or for any other reason.
 
It is the responsibility of each student to avoid duplication, in whole or in part, of the content of any courses offered
toward the degree. Such duplication may result in withdrawal of credit.

Blair School of Music
Music at Vanderbilt
Facilities
The Blair Concert Series
Blair Academy at Vanderbilt
 
The Blair School of Music focuses on the personal and professional education of highly talented young musicians
who demonstrate an exceptional capacity and motivation to shape our increasingly diverse and complex global
century—through music, with music, and in music.
 
Our unique “Blair Experience” builds on the very foundation of methods, repertories, and ensembles shared by the
world's most competitive schools of music and conservatories but goes well beyond that, immersing students in the
transformative spaces of a world-class research university committed to inclusive excellence with distinction in
areas ranging from theology to science, arts to engineering, humanities to business, and education to
law. Graduates of the Blair School are recognized as superior artists and scholars distinguished by their global
mindsets, broad interdisciplinary competencies, and unyielding commitments to advocacy, entrepreneurship, and
education.
 
The Blair School has been an integral part of Nashville’s musical environment since its founding in 1964 by the Justin
and Valere Potter Foundation through a bequest of Valere Blair Potter. In 1981 the school was merged with
Vanderbilt following the university’s decision to develop an excellent program in music. Studies leading to the
professional bachelor of music in performance were initiated in 1986.
 
The Bachelor of Music degree program includes majors in performance, composition, jazz studies, and integrated
studies. The performance major is available in any orchestral instrument, piano, saxophone, euphonium, and voice.
The major in composition emphasizes analytical skills as well as the development of students’ creativity. The jazz
studies major offers a focus on American and non-Western music traditions while also developing the core
fundamentals of Western music common to all Blair majors. The integrated studies major combines the study of
composition or a performance area with an additional concentration in music and forms the basis for a five-year
program in teacher education offered cooperatively with Peabody College. In the Bachelor of Musical Arts degree
program, composers and performers complete an in-depth music study in addition to a field outside of music.
 
A non-professional 31-hour liberal arts music major makes it possible for students outside the Blair School to choose
music as a second major. Students in other schools and colleges of the university also may pursue a minor in music,
music composition, musicology/ethnomusicology, or music performance. And Blair offers a remarkable variety of
electives for students who wish to enrich their studies with credit in music courses, ensembles, or performance
instruction, or to select music as an extracurricular activity.

Blair School of Music is home to internationally known faculty soloists and ensembles, and Blair’s performers,
composers, ethnomusicologists, and musicologists are among the most respected in their fields. Members of the
faculty ensembles provide private performance instruction and coach chamber music ensembles and performance
classes. The faculty's dedication to teaching and a low student/faculty ratio provide students the personal attention
that fosters maximum musical growth and understanding. The school is committed to its goal of developing students
who are among the most articulate, culturally aware, and artistically sensitive of any graduates in the country.
 
Facilities
The Blair building incorporates innovative developments in acoustical design and engineering. It contains teaching
studios and faculty offices, classrooms, rehearsal halls, practice rooms, library, administrative offices, technology
and keyboard labs, and concert venues. The 272-seat Steve and Judy Turner Recital Hall is the locus for student
recitals and concerts and master classes by faculty members and visiting artists held on a regular basis. It also
houses the Dobson Organ Opus 92 (2014), designed in the tradition of eighteenth-century eastern German organs
not unlike those Bach knew, with additions and accommodations for twenty-first century use. Opened in spring
2002, the 609-seat Ingram Hall garnered immediate acclaim for its superb acoustics, its visual beauty, and its
enhancement of the school’s ability to host and produce orchestra, opera, and other major concert events.
 
The Anne Potter Wilson Music Library is a division of the Jean and Alexander Heard Libraries. The collection, begun
in 1947, was moved from Peabody College to its new and permanent home at Blair in the summer of 1985. Named
to honor Anne Potter Wilson by the Vanderbilt Board of Trust in 1987, the 12,000-square-foot library holds more
than 116,000 books, scores, sound and video recordings, and subscriptions to journals and online music databases.
It is equipped with a seminar room, listening and viewing stations, computer workstations, and study facilities. A
variety of equipment is available for check out including laptops, microphones, phone chargers, midi keyboards,
headphones, and umbrellas. Music librarians and staff are available to assist users with music research and finding
resources for performance, study, or instruction.
 
The Blair Concert Series
The Blair Concert Series offers a broad array of music performances to the university community and the region.
National and international artists and ensembles, the Blair faculty, including resident ensembles and soloists, and
student ensembles and performers are all featured. All student recitals are open to the public. More than 350
concerts are presented at the school each year, and most are free of charge, as a gift to the community.
 
A milestone in the Blair School's history was “The Blair Commissions: Music for the 21st Century,” a project funded
by the James Stephen Turner Family Charitable Foundation, which has commissioned several important works by
renowned composers from 2005 through 2019. These include works by Susan Botti and Peter Schickele and four
major works by Michael Hersch. Each composition received its premiere in Nashville, and all the works were then
either recorded or performed in New York. The project has served two intertwined missions: to promote the
composition of outstanding works by the world’s leading composers and to invite attention to the excellent
ensembles and faculty performers of Vanderbilt University.
 
Composers-in-residence who have visited the Blair School include Robert Beaser, William Bolcom, Susan Botti,
George Crumb, Michael Daugherty, Lukas Foss, Gabriela Lena Frank, John Harbison, Michael Hersch, Karel Husa,
Steven Mackey, Donald Martino, Cindy McTee, Jessie Montgomery, Kevin Puts, Christopher Rouse, Adam
Schoenberg, Joseph Schwantner, Frank Ticheli, Michael Torke, and Joan Tower.
 
Blair Academy at Vanderbilt
Individual, group, class, and ensemble instruction for precollege and adult students (defined as students above high
school age not receiving university credit) is offered through the Blair Academy at Vanderbilt. Course offerings are

The Blair School of Music welcomes all Vanderbilt students into its classes and studios. A large number of courses
are designed specifically for non-majors. Many classes are held in Sarratt Cinema, Alumni Hall, and other central
campus locations. Non-majors may also participate in any and all music major courses for which they are qualified.
 
A wide variety of music courses fulfill liberal arts core requirements for undergraduates in the College of Arts and
Science, the School of Engineering, and Peabody College. Students in the School of Engineering can count up to 12
hours of MUSE, MUSO, COMP, MREP, MUTH, and performance courses, except MUSO 1001, towards liberal arts core
requirements. How students in the College of Arts and Science and Peabody College may use music courses varies
according to their specific degree and program requirements.
 
Ensembles
The Blair School of Music sponsors several major performing ensembles, including the Vanderbilt University Singers,
Vanderbilt Chorale, Orchestra, Wind Symphony, Opera Theatre, and Blair Big Band. Other non-western and
vernacular ensembles, such as the African Performing Ensemble and the Steel Drum/Pan Ensemble, are also
available for credit. A large number of smaller ensembles and chamber music groups also exist, offering students a
wide variety of experiences.
 
Auditions. Auditions for the major performing ensembles are held at the beginning of each semester. Audition
information can be found on the Blair School of Music website. Assignment is at the discretion of the director.
Students need the approval of the appropriate faculty chamber music coordinator before enrolling in chamber
music; if participation has not been discussed with the coach, students may register tentatively for the “to be
assigned” section of chamber music. Openings in ensemble are not guaranteed.
 
Credit. Students may register for course credit. Audit status or registration for zero hours may be possible with
permission of the director and the associate dean of the student's school or college.

The Degree Programs
Bachelor of Music
Bachelor of Musical Arts
Liberal Arts Core
Bachelor of Music
The Bachelor of Music degree program includes five different majors: performance, composition, jazz studies,
integrated studies, and integrated studies/teacher education. The performance major is available in any orchestral
instrument, piano, saxophone, euphonium, and voice. The composition major emphasizes both the creation and
analysis of music. The major in jazz studies combines performance, composition, improvisation, musicianship,
analysis, music technology, entrepreneurship, and an emphasis on global music. Optional concentrations are
available in collaborative arts, composition, conducting, ethnomusicology, jazz, multiple woodwinds, music and the
mind, musicology, pedagogy, or music theory. The integrated studies major provides a solid foundation in the art of
music and includes a required concentration in collaborative arts, composition, conducting, ethnomusicology, jazz,
multiple woodwinds, musicology, pedagogy, music theory, or an individually designed area.
 
The integrated studies/teacher education program, a five-year curriculum jointly developed with Peabody College, is
for students interested in earning the master of education degree and teacher licensure in addition to the bachelor
of music degree. Students in this curriculum can earn the B.Mus. degree in four years and the M.Ed. and teacher
licensure for instrumental/general or vocal/general music in the fifth year (June–May).
 
All bachelor of music degree candidates complete a program designed to ensure an intense, yet broadly-based,
understanding of the discipline of music, focused on the skills and knowledge students will need to succeed as
informed musicians of the twenty-first century. Each student must complete 126 credit hours, including 80 hours in
music. The music core (44 credit hours minimum) includes music theory, aural skills, keyboard harmony,
ethnomusicology/musicology, conducting, technology for musicians, pedagogy, and ensemble. Each major has
additional specific requirements, including performance instruction and other music courses (to fulfill 80 hours).
 
Liberal arts core requirements (minimum of 30 hours) include English, the humanities, courses chosen from history
or social science, mathematics or natural science, and academic electives. Students may take free electives to total
126 hours. Sample curriculum plans are in the Blair Student Handbook at blair.vanderbilt.edu/academics.

Bachelor of Musical Arts
The bachelor of musical arts degree gives excellent performers and composers the flexibility to combine in-depth
music study with a second focus in a field outside of music. The degree, which is available in any orchestral
instrument, piano, saxophone, euphonium, voice, jazz studies, and composition, includes 63 credit hours in music; a
specific field outside of music or an individually-designed area of interdisciplinary studies (minimum of 18 hours) is
also required. In addition to performance or composition instruction (16 hours), the music core (44 credit hours
minimum) includes music theory, aural skills, keyboard harmony, ethnomusicology/musicology, conducting,
technology for musicians, pedagogy, and ensemble. Liberal arts core requirements (minimum of 30 hours) include
English, the humanities, courses chosen from history or social science, mathematics or natural science, and
academic electives. Students may take free electives to total 126 hours.
 
Through a dual B.Mus.Arts/MBA program, interested students in the musical arts degree have an opportunity to
compress both the bachelor of musical arts at the Blair School of Music and the master of business administration at
the Owen Graduate School of Management into ten semesters in residence. Application for this program is made
early in the fall semester of the junior year. First-year students will be admitted to the B.Mus.Arts through the
admissions process of the Blair School. Students must declare the concentration within music or the field outside of
music of the B.Mus.Arts no later than the tenth day of the first semester of the junior year. Sample curriculum plans
are in the Blair Student Handbook at blair.vanderbilt.edu/academics.

The liberal arts core affords music students the opportunity to develop a broad-based understanding of intellectual
endeavors and methods in a variety of disciplines, to explore the interconnectedness of music, arts, and other
humanistic pursuits, and to articulate their thinking in clear and effective language. The curriculum, which provides
maximum flexibility for each student, requires a minimum of 30 hours (33 hours for composition majors), satisfied
through required categories as noted below. Students electing a second major outside of music complete only the
Blair liberal arts core; they are not expected to fulfill the core requirements (such as AXLE) of another Vanderbilt
school or college. Hours earned toward the Blair liberal arts core may also be counted toward a second major or
minor, if appropriate. Students admitted with a deficiency relative to high school credits must plan their liberal arts
work to overcome the deficiency. 1001 courses do not count for liberal arts core credit.
English/writing (6 hours)
Students must complete writing course MUSL 2200W during the first year. A second English/writing course* of at

English/writing course, substituting 3 hours of any academic elective. Students who do not present a score of 660
on the Evidence-Based Reading and Writing section of the SAT test (with a score of 27 in Reading and 28 in Writing
and Language), or a score of 30 on the English portion of the ACT test, must enroll in English 1100 in the first
semester.

Teacher Education
The Blair School and Peabody College offer a program for students interested in teacher licensure. Students
completing  this program earn the bachelor of music (B.Mus.) majoring in the integrated studies/teacher education
track for four years, and the master of education (M.Ed.) in the fifth year to complete professional education
requirements. During the junior year, application is made to Peabody College. The M.Ed. work requires one calendar
year, June–May. Students may elect to work toward licensure in either instrumental/general or vocal/general music,
based on their interest and ability to perform at a level sufficient for placement in the appropriate performing
ensemble. The curriculum includes a strong   music performance emphasis; a solid foundation in
musicology/ethnomusicology, theory, and the liberal arts; undergraduate and graduate courses in psychology and
education; and practica (practical experience) four of the five years of study, with at least 15 weeks of student
teaching in field placements. Practica constitute a wide variety of grade K-12 experiences, including public school,
private school, and Blair Academy programs such as Suzuki strings, Blair Children’s Chorus program, and the
Nashville Youth Orchestra program. Students complete the same music core requirements as any other B.Mus.
candidate. The liberal arts core is adapted to fulfill state licensure requirements.
 
Junior Mid-Program Review [Screening I]
All students admitted to this program at matriculation must be formally continued through a process called Junior
Mid- Program Review. Criteria for this review are listed below. Students not approved can complete the general
integrated studies major.

Admission to Student Teaching [Screening II]
The semester prior to the one in which a student plans to student teach, he/she must apply for student teaching
(Screening II) and request student teaching placements. The student should be enrolled in any remaining required
prerequisite courses. Applications will be processed in the Office of Teacher Licensure, and if eligible, forwarded to
the appropriate faculty for review and vote. It is the student’s responsibility to complete the application at the
appropriate time.
 
The criteria that must be met for a student to be admitted into student teaching are as follows:
1. Specific Academic Criteria
1. Formal admission to a teacher education program for initial licensure granted
2. Approved program of studies and licensure audit forms on file
3. Successful completion of all courses and field work required and prerequisite for student teaching
4. Minimum cumulative grade point average of 3.0 (4.0 scale)

4. Academic competence (It is possible for a student to meet minimum grade point requirements and
Page 162 of 1019 

pass all courses and still have specific academic weaknesses which might cause denial of screening
applications.)
5. Teaching competence (as evidenced by successful completion of practica requirements). It is possible
for a student to meet minimum grade point requirements and pass all courses and still have specific
performance weaknesses which might cause denial of screening applications. Each Screening II
application must be accompanied by additional documents, depending on the endorsement(s) being
sought.

placements no later than during the Student Teacher Orientation at the beginning of the student teaching semester.
 
All Vanderbilt teacher education programs are approved by the Council for the Accreditation of Educator Preparation
(CAEP). 
 
3+2 B.Mus.Arts/MBA Blair-to-Owen Program
The five-year dual-degree program between the Blair School of Music and the Owen Graduate School of
Management allows a small cohort of particularly motivated students to overlap their undergraduate course work
with work toward the MBA, facilitating the earning of both the undergraduate and graduate degrees in five years
(ten semesters). By combining three and one-half years in Vanderbilt’s Blair School of Music with one and one-half
years of study in the Owen School, students may obtain both the bachelor of musical arts and the master of business
administration in five years. The baccalaureate from the Blair School is awarded at the end of the fourth year, and
the MBA from the Owen School after the fifth year. Students interested in pursuing this program must be enrolled in
the musical arts degree.
 
Required course work includes the normal Blair course work for the musical arts degree, for a minimum of 63 credit
hours in music. The liberal arts core will also follow the requirements for the major, but must include the following
specific requirements:
 
Calculus (1 semester)
Statistics, e.g., ECON 1500: Economic Statistics
ECON 1010: Principles of Macroeconomics
ECON 1020: Principles of Microeconomics
ECON 3012: Microeconomics
 
A curriculum plan, including recommended electives, is provided in the Blair Student Handbook. 
 
Students must apply to the Owen School for admission to the five-year program during their junior year. Students
should apply in Round 1 of the MBA application cycle (typically early October) of the junior year, and early
application and a standardized test score (e.g., GMAT, GRE) are recommended. Acceptance into the five-year
program is extremely competitive and requires advanced standing earned in undergraduate courses. Being deficient
Page 163 of 1019 

in full-time work experience, the 3+2 student must enhance their portfolio with an internship and outstanding
academic performance, and also show a strong commitment to a rigorous business education. The Summer
Business Institute (Accelerator), as administered by the Owen Graduate School of Management, is strongly
recommended for 3+2 applicants prior to matriculating at Owen. The successful applicant will bring an
accomplished academic record (normally a GPA of 3.3 or better), satisfactory internship or work experience, an
ability to articulate his or her own preparedness for the work environment, and a strong endorsement from
Vanderbilt faculty.
 
Students who are accepted to the 3+2 program will remain registered as B.Mus.Arts students through fall of senior
year, and will register as Owen students in spring of senior year. Academically, students will take a full load of
business courses both in fall and spring of senior year while completing the final B.Mus.Arts degree requirements
(normally, lessons and ensembles). Students must complete a minimum of 62 credit hours at Owen over four
semesters. Fifteen hours (normally in fall of the senior year) of Owen School courses approved by Blair may be
counted toward completion of the undergraduate degree. Students with questions may contact Liz Scowden
(liz.scowden@vanderbilt.edu) in the Owen Academic and Student Affairs Office. The completion of the B.Mus.Arts
degree requirements prior to fall of the student’s fifth year is required for continuation in the MBA program.
 
Tuition and Financial Aid
The scholarship or other financial aid commitment of the Blair School will not be continued automatically beyond the
seventh semester for students enrolled in the dual-degree program. Eighth-semester financial aid is the student’s
responsibility. Students should notify the Owen School with their application if they are interested in being a
candidate for an Owen scholarship during their MBA studies. Early application is recommended. Need-based aid will
still apply.
 
Students pay tuition to the undergraduate school for the fall semester of their fourth year, after which all tuition is
paid to Owen (and reflects graduate school tuition rates). The Blair School of Music will waive fees for the required
performance instruction during spring of the fourth year to facilitate completion of the B.Mus.Arts requirements.

Vanderbilt University School of Engineering is the largest and oldest private engineering school in the South. Classes
offering engineering instruction began in 1879, and seven years later Engineering was made a separate unit with its
Page 170 of 1019 

own dean. The school’s program emphasizes the relationship of the engineering profession to society and prepares
engineers to be socially aware as well as technically competent.
 
The mission of the School of Engineering is threefold: to produce intellectual leaders, entrepreneurs, and innovators
by recruiting the best students and providing them a top-notch education; to deliver scholarship of the highest
caliber, published in the most visible venues, addressing important societal problems; and to be a leader in
entrepreneurship and innovation, in Tennessee, the U.S., and globally.
 
The school strives to meet the undergraduate education portion of its mission by offering degree programs in fields
of engineering relevant to the needs of society. An objective of these programs is to provide a technical education
integrated with strong humanities, fine arts, and social sciences subject matter to provide the requisite foundation
for lifelong learning. The availability of second majors and minors in subject areas in other schools and colleges of
the university increases opportunities for engineering students to enhance their education by pursuing studies in
the non-technical disciplines. Engineering students take close to 50 percent of their courses outside of the School of
Engineering and associate daily with peers from other schools and colleges within the university.
 
Another objective is to prepare students who intend to enter engineering practice upon graduation and those who
will continue their studies at the graduate level in engineering or in other professional fields. To this end, our
programs emphasize mathematics and engineering sciences with significant exposure to engineering design and
hands-on laboratory experiences.
 
A large fraction of the student body is destined for management positions early in their working careers. To meet
these students’ needs, the Engineering Management program offers a well-integrated minor.
 
Students at all levels have the opportunity to work with faculty in the generation of new knowledge. Those planning
for graduate studies and research are especially encouraged to participate in individual topics and research courses
to fulfill that desire. Engineering students also participate in summer research programs of the university and of the
school.
 
Facilities
The School of Engineering is housed in five main buildings with several satellite facilities. William W. Featheringill
Hall houses a three-story atrium designed for student interaction and social events, more than fifty teaching and
research laboratories with the latest equipment and computer resources, and project rooms. The Engineering and
Science Building is an eight-story state-of-the-art building that houses the Wond'ry at the Innovation Pavilion, the
Frist Center for Autism and Innovation, numerous research labs, interactive classrooms, clean rooms, and space for
students to work, study, and socialize. Olin Hall, which is attached to the Engineering and Science building, houses
Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, and Materials Science, several classrooms, and
research and teaching laboratories. School administrative offices and several classrooms are located on the ground
floor of the Science and Engineering Building in Stevenson Center, which also houses the Biomedical Engineering
department on the 8th and 9th floors. Jacobs Hall, which flanks Featheringill Hall, contains laboratories, offices, and
classrooms serving the Civil and Environmental Engineering, and Electrical and Computer Engineering departments.
Labs, offices, and meeting spaces for Computer Science are also housed at 17th & DeFord Bailey, a building that
serves as a hub for Computer Science and Data Science. Several satellite facilities are also part of the Engineering
School: the W. M. Keck Free-Electron Laser Center building, housing the labs and offices of the Biomedical Photonics
Center; the Laboratory for Systems Integrity and Reliability (LASIR), an off-campus hangar-style facility dedicated to
scaling up experiments to realistic and full size that houses a wind tunnel and military aircraft; the Vanderbilt
Institute of Software Integrated Systems; and the Institute for Space and Defense Electronics.
 
In all its engineering programs, Vanderbilt recognizes the vital place of experimental and research laboratories in
the learning experience. Laboratories are designed to provide the strongest personal contact between students and
faculty members consistent with enrollment.
Page 171 of 1019 

 
Well-equipped undergraduate laboratories are maintained by the Chemistry and Physics & Astronomy departments
in the College of Arts and Science, which offers mathematics and basic science courses required of all engineering
students. Graduate and undergraduate divisions of these departments maintain teaching and research facilities in
the Stevenson Center for the Natural Sciences. Another supporting department, Biological Sciences, is housed in
Medical Research Building III. Most classes in humanities and the social sciences are conducted in Buttrick, Calhoun,
Furman, Garland, and Wilson halls.
 
Professional Registration and Accreditation
Legislation exists in the various states requiring registration of all engineers who contract with the public to perform
professional work. Although many engineering positions do not require professional certification, Vanderbilt
supports registration and encourages its graduates to take the Fundamentals of Engineering examination as soon as
they become eligible.
 
Bachelor of engineering degrees in biomedical engineering, chemical engineering, civil engineering, electrical and
computer engineering, and mechanical engineering are accredited as noted below. Students in these programs may
take the Fundamentals of Engineering examination as seniors. In addition, proven professional experience is a
requirement for registration. Some state boards may have additional requirements for licensure.
 
All programs leading to the Bachelor of Engineering degree and the program leading to the Bachelor of Science in
computer science are accredited as follows:
 
The Bachelor of Engineering degree program in biomedical engineering is accredited by the Engineering
Accreditation Commission of ABET, https://www.abet.org/, under the General Criteria and the Program Criteria for
Bioengineering and Biomedical and Similarly Named Engineering Programs.
 
The Bachelor of Engineering degree program in civil engineering is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation
Commission of ABET, https://www.abet.org/, under the General Criteria and the Program Criteria for Civil and

Employment of Graduates
Of the recent Vanderbilt graduates with baccalaureate degrees in engineering, about 75 percent entered directly
into professional practice. Twenty-five percent continued with graduate or professional education. Others pursued
diverse careers or other interests. Additional information regarding the employment of engineering graduates is
available on the School of Engineering's website and in the VU Career Center.
Supporting Organizations
Vanderbilt Engineering Council
The Engineering Council is a student organization whose main goal is facilitating community among undergraduate
students in the School of Engineering by organizing activities, e.g., Engineering Week, de-stress events around final
examinations, and many more. Additionally, the council acts as a student voice to school administration and faculty.
Representatives of engineering student organizations apply to serve on the E-Council leadership team, and the
current leadership board selects and trains the new members. While the council has no administrative power, it
provides students with a voice in the decision- making process in the School of Engineering.
Professional Societies
The leading national engineering societies have chartered branches or student sections at Vanderbilt. These
organizations are run locally by students with the help of a faculty adviser. Meetings are devoted to matters of a
technical nature, including outside speakers, plant trips, and other subjects of interest to the membership.
 
Students are invited to attend meetings and join as they will find the work of the professional societies beneficial in
orienting them in their careers.
 
The student professional societies are:
 
American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics
(A.I.A.A.)
Institute for Electrical and Electronics Engineers (I.E.E.E.)
American Institute of Chemical Engineers (AICh.E)
National Society of Black Engineers (N.S.B.E.)

Undergraduate Degrees
The First Year
Most courses normally scheduled for the first year are common to both the B.E. and B.S. degree programs. While the
curriculum for the first year is generally the same for all students, there are important variations. For example, some
major programs require a full year of introductory chemistry; others do not. Students should become familiar with
requirements of those programs in which they have an interest and confer with their adviser at the time of
enrollment and throughout the first year to plan a program of study that will keep options open as long as possible.
 
Specimen curricula for the engineering programs are given in the Courses of Study section. Requirements for the
B.E. and B.S. degrees for the various programs vary in the minimum amount of hours and in specific course
requirements in the basic sciences and in mathematics.
 
Included in the first year for all majors is the course Engineering Science 1401–1403 Introduction to Engineering,
which introduces the student to design tools used in all areas of engineering.
Mathematics and Physics
Entering engineering students will be placed in the appropriate level mathematics course. Students having one full
year or more of high school credit in analytic geometry and calculus may qualify for advanced placement in a
regular sequence by scoring well on the Advanced Placement Examination.
 
Students with high mathematical ability and achievement as demonstrated by testing credit or credit by
examination through the Department of Mathematics may begin in the next mathematics course for which they
qualify (e.g., MATH 1301 or 2300). For more information, see the testing credit information under Advanced Credit in
the Admissions section of this catalog and course descriptions under Mathematics in the Arts and Science section of
this catalog. For majors requiring Math 2420 (Methods of Ordinary Differential Equations), students may select Math
2400 (Differential Equations with Linear Algebra) or Math 2610 (Ordinary Differential Equations) as a substitute.
 
First-year students with a test score of 5 on the Calculus-BC Advanced Placement examination and who wish to
pursue the honors track of a second major in mathematics may take MATH 2500-2501, which will cover the material
from MATH 2300 and 2600 but in a deeper and integrated fashion. Note that while linear algebra is required for
some VUSE majors, no VUSE major specifically requires 2600. Students considering this option must discuss this
with the Director of Undergraduate Studies in Mathematics and the School of Engineering Office of Academic
Services.
 
Students with inadequate backgrounds in mathematics may be required to take Math 1005 (Pre-calculus
Mathematics). Taking this course constitutes an additional requirement for graduation.
 
Math 1010-1011 (Probability and Statistical Inference) and Math 1100 (Survey of Calculus) cannot be credited
toward a degree in the School of Engineering.
 
Students with greater interest in physics may enroll in Phys 1911, 1912, 1912L, and 2255L (Principles of Physics I
and II and labs) as substitutes for Phys 1601, 1602, 1601L, and 1602L (General Physics I and II and labs),
respectively. Students should consult with their Academic Adviser before taking this more advanced Physics
sequence.
 
Pre-calculus courses Phys 1010, 1010L, 1020, 1020L, 2051, 2052, 2053, and 2054 cannot be credited toward a
degree in the School of Engineering.

Immersion
Immersion Vanderbilt (vanderbilt.edu/immersion) allows students to pursue a multi-year path to be curious, to
develop their passions and to learn by experience. To fulfill the university requirement of Immersion Vanderbilt, a
student must participate in immersive experiences and then complete a culminating project that is based on one
specific immersive experience as described in the Special Programs for Undergraduates section near the start of this
catalog.
The experiential learning may focus on one or more areas of student interest. Most engineering students will take
advantage of a four-year engineering design experience to satisfy the requirements of Immersion Vanderbilt. Each
engineering major offers such a multi-year experience within its curriculum. Students whose plans include
professional development may also pursue industrial internships. A research path can engage the student in
discovery through research in engineering or other fields. While most engineering students will select an immersion
experience associated with their major, students can pursue an Immersion plan outside their home program. For
example, students interested in creative expression might develop a performance piece, exhibit, or artistic work,
while those interested in international study may explore firsthand the culture, language, and history of other
countries. Students interested in such immersion plans should consult the Office of Experiential Learning and
Immersion (EL&IV).
 
The Immersion Vanderbilt process is composed of several phases. Senior design projects in the School of
Engineering satisfy the final project requirement for Immersion Vanderbilt, with students presenting the results of
their design project at the school's Design Day or Computer Science Immersion Showcase. For students completing
other immersion projects, the Office of Experiential Learning and Immersion Vanderbilt coordinates a series of
showcases open to the entire campus where students display their projects. Upon completion of the project, Office
of Experiential Learning and Immersion Vanderbilt conveys that the requirements have been met by showing
completion of the Immersion Vanderbilt graduation requirement on the student's degree audit.
Open Electives
Courses taken beyond specified courses and restricted (such as program, technical, and liberal arts) electives for the
major may be taken as open electives.
Officer Education
Course offerings in military science and naval science are described in the section on Special Programs for
Page 176 of 1019 

Undergraduates near the beginning of the catalog. All officer education courses designated as eligible for credit may
be taken as open electives. In addition, some officer education courses in history and political science may be taken
as part of the Liberal Arts Core while some officer education courses in engineering science may be taken as
technical electives. AFROTC students may count 6 hours of the military courses as open electives.
Master of Engineering
The master of engineering (M.Eng.) is an advanced professional degree awarded by the School of Engineering and
especially designed for engineering practitioners who may prefer to work while doing professional study. It is also
suitable for individuals who apply directly from undergraduate school—but the thrust of the program is toward
professional practice in engineering rather than research or teaching. The degree is offered in biomedical
engineering, chemical engineering, civil engineering, cyber-physical systems, engineering in surgery and
intervention, engineering management, environmental engineering, mechanical engineering, and risk, reliability,
and resilience engineering.
 
Students must complete 30 hours of approved course work. A maximum of 6 hours of graduate-level course work
may be transferred from another institution, and a maximum period of seven years is allowed to complete the
degree. An extensive, written design report shall be submitted on a project approved by the student’s project
adviser.
 
Regular admission to the Master of Engineering program normally requires graduation from an approved
undergraduate program in engineering or a related scientific discipline, attainment of a B average in undergraduate
courses applicable to the student’s career goals, and recommendations containing favorable appraisals of
professional promise and attitude. A period of successful work experience prior to application to the program will
also be given consideration. For information about admissions, application procedures, and application deadlines for
the Master of Engineering programs, please visit https://engineering.vanderbilt.edu/academics/master-of-
engineering-degree.
 
Current undergraduates in the School of Engineering may be eligible to earn the Master of Engineering via the
Integrated Bachelor and Master of Engineering program described in the next section of this catalog.
 
For international students who did not graduate from an institution in a country where English is the official
language, proficiency in English must be shown by a minimum score of 89 on the TOEFL or 7 on the IELTS test.
Digital Learning Programs
The School of Engineering offers two degree programs online: an M.S. in Computer Science, and an M.Eng. in
Engineering Management. Courses in these digital learning programs are only available to students enrolled in
these online degree programs. For information about admissions, application procedures, and application deadlines

Honors Programs
Honors programs allow selected undergraduate students to develop individually through independent study and
research. Honors programs of each major are described in the Courses of Study section.
 
Requirements vary somewhat but, in general, to qualify for consideration a student should have (a) completed the
technical course requirements of the first two years, (b) attained a minimum grade average of 3.5 in all work taken
for credit, and (c) shown evidence indicating a capacity for independent study and/or research. Formal admission is
by election of the department concerned. Once admitted, candidates remain in the program only if they maintain a
3.5 or higher grade point average.
 
Accepted candidates normally begin honors study in the junior year, but exceptions may be made for outstanding
seniors.
 
Successful candidates are awarded Honors in their major. This designation appears on their diplomas.
Study Abroad
Vanderbilt's Global Education Office offers approximately thirty programs that allow students to take engineering or
computer science courses in English abroad, in locations ranging from Dublin to Sydney, Madrid to Hong Kong.
There are no language prerequisites for these programs. These programs also allow students to take a range of
liberal arts core, major core, and elective courses abroad. In no case, after matriculating at Vanderbilt, may a
student participate in a Vanderbilt-approved study abroad program through a different university or through an
external agency and then seek to transfer that credit into Vanderbilt. Financial aid can be used for study abroad
during the academic year, and scholarships are available to support Vanderbilt-approved summer study abroad
options. Students are encouraged to discuss with their academic advisers how best to incorporate study abroad into
their four-year plans of study. All students who study abroad must register their travel in advance with Vanderbilt’s
international security provider.
 
Registration is completed on your behalf when enrolling in a program offered through the Global Education Office.
Otherwise, information is available on the GlobalVU website: vanderbilt.edu/global.
Teacher Education
Students who are interested in preparing for licensure as secondary school teachers should plan their programs in
consultation with the associate dean in the School of Engineering and the Director of Secondary Education in the
Department of Teaching and Learning at Peabody College. More specific information on professional education
course requirements can be found under the Licensure for Teaching chapter in the Peabody College section of this
catalog. Inquiries can also be made to the Office of Teacher Licensure at Peabody.
Second Major
It is possible for a student to combine an engineering field with a second area outside the School of Engineering.
The student must obtain prior approval of each department and satisfy the requirements of each major, including
the requirement regarding minimum grade point average. Students in the School of Engineering may use courses
outside the School of Engineering for relevant second majors even if those courses also fulfill a degree requirement.
 
Certain double majors involving two programs within the School of Engineering have been approved by the faculty.
The approved double majors are biomedical engineering/electrical and computer engineering, and biomedical
engineering/chemical engineering.
Page 178 of 1019 

 
Both majors are indicated on the student’s transcript. Only one degree is awarded, from the school in which the
student is enrolled.
Minors
A minor consists of at least five courses of at least 3 credit hours each within a recognized area of knowledge. A
minor offers students more than a casual introduction to an area, but less than a major. A minor is not a degree
requirement, but students may elect to complete one or more. Courses may not be taken on a Pass/Fail basis. A
minor for which all designated courses are completed with a grade point average of at least 2.000 will be entered on
the transcript at the time of graduation.
 
When a minor is offered in a discipline that offers a major, only those courses that count toward the major may be
counted toward the minor. Students should refer to the appropriate sections of this catalog for specific
requirements. Minors are offered in engineering management, materials science and engineering, computer
science, data science, digital fabrication, electrical and computer engineering, energy and environmental systems,
environmental engi​neering, nanoscience and nanotechnology, quantum information science and engineering,
scientific computing, and most disciplines of the College of Arts and Science, Blair School of Music, and Peabody
College.
 
Students declare their intention to pursue a minor by completing the online Major/Minor Declaration/Change
workflow process found here: https://registrar.vanderbilt.edu/registration/forms.php. Departments and programs
usually assign advisers to students who declare minors in their areas. Students are responsible for knowing and
satisfying all requirements for the minors they intend to complete.
Focus Areas
Focus areas provide guidance to students wishing to concentrate on a specialized topic within engineering. Focus
areas are typically nine credit hours, and qualifying courses are listed in the catalog. Students can declare a
maximum of three focus areas; however, a qualifying course cannot be applied to more than one focus area.
Students interested in declaring a focus area must do so before the start of their final semester at Vanderbilt.
Successful completion of a declared focus area will be designated on a student's transcript upon graduation.
The School of Engineering offers the following focus areas:
Human Computer Interaction
Microelectronics
Nanotechnology
Strategic and Technical Consulting
Engineering Communications
Technology Entrepreneurship
Product Development
Dual Degree Program with Fisk University
A coordinated dual degree program between the Vanderbilt University School of Engineering and Fisk University is
especially designed to permit students to obtain an A.B. degree in biology, chemistry, computer science, physics, or
mathematics from Fisk and a B.E. degree in engineering from Vanderbilt, generally within five years.
 
For the first three years, the student is enrolled at Fisk in a science or mathematics curriculum and, by cross-
registration in the second and third years, takes introductory engineering courses at Vanderbilt. During the fourth
and fifth years, the student is enrolled at Vanderbilt, following principally an engineering curriculum at Vanderbilt
and completing necessary courses at Fisk. At the end of five years, the student should be able to satisfy the
requirements for both bachelor’s degrees.
 
Financial aid is available for qualified, deserving students. Additional information is available from the director of
Page 179 of 1019 

transfer admissions in the Office of Undergraduate Admissions.
Integrated Bachelor and Master of Engineering
On the basis of recommendations containing favorable appraisals of professional promise, undergraduate students
in the School of Engineering who have completed at least 75 hours by the end of the second year with at least a
3.500 grade point average may be accepted into an integrated Bachelor of Engineering–Master of Engineering
program. This program is currently available in chemical, civil, environmental, or mechanical engineering. This
program can also be completed with the Master of Engineering degree in Engineering in Surgery and Intervention
(ESI) in combination with the bachelor's degree in biomedical, mechanical, electrical and computer engineering, or
engineering science. The last two years of a student’s program are planned as a unit.
 
With the approval of the student’s adviser, the director of graduate studies in the student’s major department, and
the senior associate dean for undergraduate education, students apply through the senior associate dean for
graduate education for admission to this integrated dual degree program. Upon admission to this program, a
second “career” will be set up for the student which will allow the student to start taking graduate courses (course
numbers > 5000) during the junior and senior years. These courses will be credited toward the master of
engineering.
 
Note that no double counting of courses is allowed (i.e., the student must meet the degree requirements for each
degree independent of the other degree). No more than 18 total credit hours between the two careers can be taken
in a single semester. The student typically receives the bachelor’s degree at the end of the fourth year and
completes the master of engineering during the fifth year. Further information can be obtained from the director of
graduate studies of the student’s major department.
Accelerated Graduate Program in Engineering
Students who enter Vanderbilt with a significant number of credits, earned either through Advanced Placement or
International Baccalaureate tests or in college courses taken during high school, may be eligible for the Accelerated
Graduate Program in Engineering. Through this program, a student is able to earn both a bachelor’s degree and a
master of science in about the same time required for the bachelor’s degree or slightly longer. To be eligible for the
program, a student must complete 86 hours (senior standing) by the end of the sophomore year with at least a
3.500 grade point average. With the approval of the student’s adviser, the director of graduate studies in the
student’s major department, and the senior associate dean for undergraduate education, students apply through the
senior associate dean for graduate education for admission to this accelerated dual degree program. Upon
admission to this program, a second “career” will be set up for the student which will allow the student to start
taking graduate courses (course numbers > 5000) during the junior and senior years. These courses will be credited
toward the master of science.
 
Note that no double counting of courses is allowed (i.e., the student must meet the degree requirements for each
degree independent of the other degree). No more than 18 total credit hours between the two careers can be taken
in a single semester. The student receives the bachelor’s degree at the end of the fourth year and typically spends
the summer finishing a master’s thesis to complete the master of science. Further information can be obtained from
the director of graduate studies of the student’s major department.

COURSES OFFERED: BME
 
The foundations of biomedical engineering are the same as those in other engineering disciplines: mathematics,
physics, chemistry, and engineering principles. Biomedical engineering builds on these foundations to solve
problems in biology  and medicine over the widest range of scales-from the nanoscale and molecular levels to the
whole body. Biomedical engineering provides a robust platform for employment in the medical device and
instrumentation industries as well as careers in companies that specialize in the development and application of
biologics, biomaterials, computation, implants and processes. Our graduates gain entry into nationally recognized
graduate schools for continuing studies in biomedical engineering.
 
Biomedical engineering is also a rigorous path for admission to and success in medical school for those students
Page 185 of 1019 

willing and able to excel in mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, physiology, and engineering.
 
The Department of Biomedical Engineering at Vanderbilt is unique among biomedical engineering programs in its
immediate proximity to the world class Vanderbilt Medical Center, located on our compact campus. Our School of
Medicine is among the top ten in funding from the National Institutes of Health and includes a National Cancer
Institute- recognized Comprehensive Cancer Center, a major children’s hospital and a Level I trauma center. This
proximity and the strong relationships among faculty across multiple schools stimulate high impact research and
provide unique educational and research opportunities for students.
 
Degree Programs. The Department of Biomedical Engineering offers courses of study leading to the B.E., M.S.,
M.Eng., and Ph.D. Vanderbilt biomedical engineering is a well-established program with undergraduate degrees
granted continuously since 1965. Our undergraduate curriculum undergoes regular review and revision to ensure
relevancy and to maintain full ABET accreditation. Students have complete flexibility in the selection of biomedical
engineering, technical, and open electives. This allows students to design their own focus areas such as
regenerative medicine and tissue engineering, wearables and point-of-care diagnostics, global health, surgery and
engineering, robotics and prosthetics, lasers and medicine, medical imaging, biotechnology and nanomedicine,
medical technology and entrepreneurship.
 
Facilities. The Department of Biomedical Engineering is located in Stevenson Center. Undergraduate instructional
laboratories are equipped for study of biomedical processes, measurement methods and instrumentation. These
facilities are equipped with embedded systems for instrumentation, design, and testing that mirror professional
practice. Specialized facilities for biomedical imaging, biophotonics, cell and tissue culture, microfabrication, surgery
and intervention, and nanoengineering are used both for faculty-led research and instructional purposes.
 
Undergraduate Honors Program. With approval of the Honors Program director, junior and senior students in
biomedical engineering who have achieved a minimum grade point average of 3.5 may be accepted into the
undergraduate Honors Program. Students in the program take at least 6 credit hours of 5000-level or above
(graduate) biomedical engineering courses, which can be counted toward the 127-hour undergraduate degree
requirements as biomedical engineering electives or which can be taken for graduate school credit. Students in the
Honors Program must also complete a two-semester-long research project and present a research report; this is
generally accomplished through the BME 3860 and 3861 Undergraduate Research elective courses. Honors students
must make a grade point average of 3.0 in these classes and maintain an overall 3.5 GPA to be designated as an
honors graduate. The diploma designation is Honors in Biomedical Engineering.

Chemical engineers play key roles in the development and production of commodity chemicals, pharmaceuticals,
and bioengineered materials, high strength composites and specialty polymers, semiconductors and microelectronic
devices, and a wide range of ultrapure fine chemicals. Indeed, chemical engineering is essential for the operation of
contemporary society. The solutions to many of the problems that we face today—e.g., energy, the environment,
Page 189 of 1019 

development of high-performance materials—will involve chemical engineers.
 
The undergraduate program in chemical engineering prepares students to contribute to the solution of these and
similar problems. Graduates find meaningful careers in industry, in government laboratories, and as consultants.
Some continue their education through graduate studies in chemical engineering, business, law, or medicine.
 
Mission. The mission of the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering is to educate those who will
advance the knowledge base in chemical engineering, become practicing chemical engineers, and be leaders in the
chemical and process industries, academia, and government; to conduct both basic and applied research in
chemical engineering and related interdisciplinary areas; and to provide service to the chemical engineering
profession, the School of Engineering, Vanderbilt University, the country, and the world.
 
Degree Programs. The Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering offers the B.E. in chemical
engineering and graduate study leading to the M.Eng., M.S., and Ph.D.
 
Undergraduate chemical engineering students acquire a solid background in mathematics, chemistry, biology,
physics, and computing. The chemical and biomolecular engineering program has as its basis courses in transport
phenomena, thermodynamics, separations, and kinetics. Other courses deal with the principles and techniques of
chemical engineering analysis and design, along with economic analysis, process control, chemical process safety,
bioprocessing, process simulation, and engineering ethics. Laboratory courses offer the student an opportunity to
make fundamental measurements of momentum, heat, and mass transport and to gain hands-on experience with
bench scale and small scale pilot-plant equipment, which can be computer controlled. Effective report writing and
technical communication are principal skills gained in the laboratory and design courses. Many students carry out
individual research projects.
 
A specimen curriculum for a chemical engineering major follows. This standard program includes electives that
students, in consultation with their faculty advisers, select to pursue breadth or a minor or focus area with their
chemical engineering major. Specimen curricula with emphases in specific areas are available on the department
website. Double majors may be arranged in consultation with a faculty adviser.
 
Students are recommended to take the Fundamentals of Engineering Examination (FE) in their senior year. This is
the first step in obtaining a license as a professional engineer. The following courses are recommended for
preparation for the FE: ECE 2112, CE 2200, and ME 2190.
 
Undergraduate Honors Program. The Honors Program in chemical engineering provides an opportunity for selected
students to develop individually through independent study and research. General requirements are described in
the Special Programs chapter. The chemical and biomolecular engineering department requires a minimum overall
GPA of 3.5. Acceptance to the program is made by petition to the faculty during the junior year. Transfer students
may be considered for admission after completing one semester at Vanderbilt. Candidates for honors choose their
technical courses with the consent of a faculty honors adviser. Requirements include at least 6 hours of CHBE
courses numbered 5000 or above, plus 6 hours of CHBE 3860 and 3861 taken in the junior and/or senior year under
the direction of a faculty honors adviser. A formal written research report is submitted each semester CHBE 3860 or
3861 is taken with a final report and presentation given in the spring semester of the senior year to the CHBE
faculty and students. The diploma designation is Honors in Chemical Engineering.
 
Facilities. The Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering department is located in Olin Hall. Undergraduate
instructional laboratories are equipped for study of transport phenomena, unit operations, kinetics, and process
control. Current research areas for which facilities are available include molecular modeling; colloid and surface
science; biochemical engineering and biotechnology; materials processing and characterization; energy and the

COURSES OFFERED: CE
 
Vanderbilt's Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering offers a broad-based education in civil and
environmental engineering fundamentals, coupled with development of leadership, management, and
communications skills to establish a foundation for lifelong learning and flexible career development. This goal
requires going beyond technical competence in a balanced education to develop future leaders in the fields of
consulting, industry, business, law, government, and research.
 
B.E. in civil engineering. Civil engineers must be able to face complex problems of modern society involving the
development of physical facilities that serve the public while protecting the environment and preserving social
values. Challenges facing civil and environmental engineers concern housing, urban transportation, pollution
control, water resources development, industrial development, maintaining and advancing our nation’s aging
infrastructure, and exploring space. Addressing these challenges with today’s limited resources requires innovative
and original ideas from highly-skilled engineers.
 
Undergraduates majoring in civil engineering receive a strong background in mathematics, science, engineering
science, and engineering design. The program also includes courses in economics, humanities, social sciences,
resources management, and public policy. Students participate in design teams and laboratory studies as well as
classroom activities. Use of various computer-based methods is integral to problem solving and design.
 
Vanderbilt’s B.E. in civil engineering prepares students for entry-level positions in many specialty areas of civil
engineering, as well as many other types of careers, such as business, construction, and law. Today, however, and
even more so in the future, professional practice at a high level will require an advanced degree. We recommend
that students seriously consider pursuing the M.S. or M. Eng. soon after obtaining the B.E.
 
B.E./M.Eng. Five Year Program. Students seeking advanced study in civil and environmental engineering may be
Page 194 of 1019 

interested in the combined B.E./M.Eng., enabling students to complete the B.E. in civil engineering and M.Eng. in
civil engineering or environmental engineering in five years.
 
Construction Management Five Year Program. Students seeking advanced study in construction management may
be interested in the combined B.E./M.Eng., enabling students to complete the B.E. in civil engineering and M.Eng. in
civil engineering (construction management emphasis) in five years.
 
Undergraduate Honors Program. Recognized with the diploma designation Honors in Civil Engineering, exceptional
students may be invited in their junior year to participate in the civil engineering Honors Program. Designed as a
unique individualized educational experience, participants work closely with departmental faculty members to tailor
a selection of courses that actively immerses them in a selected field of study. Experiences include enrollment in a 3
semester hour independent study course and participation in a summer research internship. Honors Program
participants are especially well-prepared to enter graduate study, and they may count the independent study course
towards their civil engineering technical electives.
 
Facilities. The civil engineering laboratory provides for static and dynamic testing of materials and structural
components and assemblies. Testing facilities include capabilities of testing composites, metals, and concrete under
static loads, fatigue, base acceleration (to simulate seismic events) and intermediate to high speed impacts (to
simulate responses to blast events). Full soils testing facilities are available. Hydraulics facilities include several
model flow systems to illustrate principles of fluid mechanics and hydrology. The transportation laboratory is
computer-based, with emphasis on transportation systems and design, intelligent transportation systems, and
geographic information systems. The environmental laboratories are fully supplied with modern instrumentation for
chemical, physical, biological, and radiological analysis of soils, sediments, water, wastewater, air, and solid waste.
They include equipment for the study of biological waste treatment, physical-chemical waste treatment,
containment mass transfer, and state-of-the-art instrumentation. All are available for student use in courses,
demonstrations, and research.

COURSES OFFERED: ECE
 
The program in computer engineering deals with the organization, design, and application of digital processing
systems as general-purpose computers or as embedded systems, i.e., components of information processing,
control, and communication systems. The program provides a strong engineering background centered on digital
technology combined with an understanding of the principles and techniques of computer science. Computer
engineering is design-oriented. The basic principles of engineering and computer science are applied to the task at
hand, which may be the design of a digital processor, processor peripheral, or a complete digital processor-based
system.
 
Page 198 of 1019 

Whatever the undertaking, the comprehensive academic training in this program enables engineers to evaluate the
impact of their decisions, whether working with hardware, software, or the interface between the two.
 
The computer engineering program combines fundamental core requirements with flexibility to allow students to
specialize in a variety of emphasis areas within the program. The curriculum includes requirements in the basic
sciences, mathematics, and humanities; a primary core of hardware and software courses; and a set of electives
that combine breadth and depth requirements as described below. Students who major in computer engineering
who wish to apply for graduate study in electrical engineering or computer science are encouraged strongly to
select their elective courses to demonstrate depth in that particular area; the structure of the program enables that
option. The course of study leads to a bachelor of engineering.
 
Undergraduate Honors Program. With faculty approval, junior and senior students may be accepted into the Honors
Program. To achieve honors status, the student must:
1. achieve and maintain a minimum GPA of 3.5.
2. complete 3 hours of undergraduate research (ECE 3860, 3861 or CS 3860, 3861) with final written report
3. complete 6 hours of ECE program elective credit from the following list:
a. up to 3 additional hours of undergraduate research (ECE 3860, 3861 or CS 3860, 3861), or
b. design domain expertise (DE) courses beyond the one course required by the program, or
c. CS 3259, CS 3892, CS 4287, or
d. 5000-level courses.
The diploma designation is Honors in Computer Engineering.
 
Facilities. Electrical and computer engineering supports undergraduate laboratories emphasizing the principal areas
of the disciplines: analog and digital electronics, microcomputers, microprocessors, microelectronics, and
instrumentation. In addition, several specialized facilities are available for graduate research: the advanced carbon
nanotechnology and diamond labs, the Institute for Software Integrated Systems, the Institute for Space and
Defense Electronics, the Medical Image Processing Laboratory, the Center for Intelligent Systems and Robotics
Laboratories, the Embedded Computer Systems Laboratory, and biomedical, biosensing, and photonics laboratories.
 
The work in electrical and computer engineering is supported by a variety of computers and networks, including the
high-performance computing facilities of the Advanced Computing Center for Research and Education. Vanderbilt is
one of the founding partners in the Internet II initiative.
 
Students interested in the major or minor in Computer Engineering are encouraged to consider instead
those in Electrical and Computer Engineering.
 
The major or minor in Computer Engineering may no longer be declared. CmPE students will be

The Division of Engineering Science and Management administers the engineering science major, the engineering
management minor, and the first-year introduction to engineering course. The division oversees non-traditional
engineering study and advises students on course selection to meet specific career goals that traditional
engineering majors may not provide.
 
COURSES OFFERED: ENGM, ES
Engineering Science Major (Bachelor of Science)
The engineering science major is flexible and interdisciplinary—offering students the opportunity to select a program
of study to meet special interests or objectives. Many students choose a program of study in engineering
management, communication of science and technology, various engineering concentrations, environmental
science or materials  science; however, students may develop unique plans of study to specialize in areas for which
facilities and faculty competence exist but which are not covered within a single existing degree program at
Vanderbilt. Engineering science graduates may establish careers in engineering or science, interface with engineers
(e.g., in marketing and sales), or use their analytical and problem-solving skills to build future professional careers.
Defined areas of concentration exist in engineering management, communication of science and technology,
secondary education, and materials science and engineering. Individual programs have been developed for students
interested in careers in engineering mathematics, environmental engineering, transportation engineering, teaching,
technical communications, and other areas requiring nontraditional combinations of engineering courses. Because
of the flexible nature of the engineering science programs of study, accreditation has not been sought for these
programs of study, and engineering science majors will not qualify for engineering licensure in most states.
 
Engineering Management. Engineering management is an interdisciplinary program of study designed to give
students the tools to manage technology development and innovation, to enhance manufacturing quality and
productivity in a competitive international environment, and to implement these objectives successfully in an
Page 212 of 1019 

organization. Engineering management links engineering, science, and the management disciplines. In addition to
the core science and math courses required of all engineering students, topics of study include entrepreneurship,
human resources management, finance in technology-based organizations, technology strategy, communications,
and operations.
 
Communication of Science and Technology. Many careers that are attractive to graduates of the engineering science
program require the communication of engineering and science to people who are not technically trained. The
Communication of Science and Technology interdisciplinary program prepares engineering students for careers in
areas such as technical consulting, high-technology marketing and sales, environmental law, and journalism. The
program combines traditional engineering and science courses with communications and humanities courses in a
flexible curriculum. Engineering science majors may select from a set of program electives identified by the faculty
committee of the School of Engineering and the College of Arts and Science that supervises the program.
 
Minors. Students may also pursue a minor consisting of at least five courses of at least three credit hours within a
recognized area of knowledge. Minors are offered in engineering management, materials science and engineering,
computer engineering, electrical engineering, computer science, scientific computing, environmental engineering,
energy and environmental systems, nanoscience and nanotechnology, and most disciplines within the College of
Arts and Science. Students must declare their intention to pursue minors by completing forms available in the Office
of Academic Services of the School of Engineering.
Curriculum Requirements
The B.S. in engineering science requires a minimum of 122 hours, distributed as follows:
1. Basic Science (16 hours). CHEM 1601, 1601L plus 12 hours from BSCI 1510, 1510L, 1511, 1511L; CHEM 1602,
1602L; PHYS 1601, 1601L, 1602, 1602L; or MSE 1500, 1500L with two courses in a single discipline.

and ENGM), except BME 1015; CS 1000, 1151; DS 1000, 2100; ES 1115, 2700, 3884; ENGM 2440,
4800; and any School of Engineering courses numbered 2860.
d. Senior Capstone (5 hours): ES 4950, 4951, 4959.
4. Liberal Arts Core (18 hours). To be selected to fulfill the Liberal Arts Core requirements listed in the Degree
Programs in Engineering.
5. Open Electives (6 hours).
6. Program Concentration (24 hours). In consultation with the academic adviser, each student must identify a
meaningful sequence of courses, not counting certain introductory-level courses, that directly contributes to
meeting stated career goals. Program concentrations are approved by the academic adviser and the program
director in advance and become part of the student’s degree audit.
The preparation provided by the program concentration, together with a solid foundation in basic engineering
courses, provides the engineering science student a strong and useful career base.
 
No more than 24 credit hours of business-related course work (BUS, BUSA, ENGM, FNEC, MGRL) may be applied to
the ES degree program. Only one business-related minor (BUS, ENGM, FNEC, MGRL, HOD) may count to a student’s
academic program. No more than 6 credit hours of courses numbered 3840 to 3879 in any program may be applied
to the ES degree program.
 
Undergraduates in engineering science may apply the pass/ fail option only to courses taken as liberal arts core or
open electives, subject to the school requirements for pass/fail. UNIV courses are eligible for open elective credit
only. Credit for the senior capstone sequence (4 hours) satisfies the Immersion Vanderbilt requirement.

B.E. in environmental engineering. The curriculum includes analysis and design courses in environmental
engineering. Vanderbilt’s B.E. in environmental engineering prepares students for entry-level positions in many
specialty areas of environmental engineering, as well as a variety of other careers, such as business, government,
and law. The major will provide students with the tools necessary to develop effective solutions to solve emerging
and existing issues such as water resources, quality, and treatment; aging infrastructures; climate change and
carbon neutral innovations; energy and material resources; wastes and pollution; and other environmental
challenges. Recognizing that environmental solutions cannot be realized without consideration of social, cultural,
economic, and political factors, students will be required to extend the breadth of their studies with courses in data
science and global perspectives courses in social sciences, economics, political sciences, and the humanities.  These
will be in addition to foundational courses in the basic and applied sciences, mathematics, engineering, and
advanced courses in fate, transport, and treatment of contaminants in the environment. The curriculum culminates
with a senior design project in which students will have the opportunity to draw on and integrate the broad
knowledge they have gained from the data science and global perspectives courses with the science and
engineering knowledge they gained in the major. Due to the complex interdisciplinary nature of the field, many
undergraduate students continue their environmental engineering education and earn either a professional (MEng)
degree or a graduate (MS or PhD) degree. 
Page 214 of 1019 

 
Undergraduate Honors Program. The Honors Program in environmental engineering provides an opportunity for
selected students to develop individually through independent study and research. The environmental engineering
honors program requires a minimum overall GPA of 3.5. Acceptance to the program is made by petition to the
faculty during the junior year. Transfer students may be considered for admission after completing one semester at
Vanderbilt. Candidates for honors choose their technical courses with the consent of a faculty honors adviser. A
three-credit hour independent study course and a summer research internship with a final report and presentation
given in the spring semester of the senior year to the ENVE faculty and students are required. The independent
study course may also be counted towards the environmental engineering technical electives. The diploma
designation is Honors in Environmental Engineering.
 
Facilities: The environmental laboratories are fully supplied with modern instrumentation for chemical, physical,
biological, and radiological analysis of soils, sediments, water, wastewater, air, and solid waste. They include
equipment for the study of biological waste treatment, physical-chemical waste treatment, contaminant mass
transfer, and state-of-the-art instrumentation.   All are available for student use in courses, demonstrations, and
research.

The vitality of our nation depends upon innovation in the design of new machines, devices to satisfy society’s needs,
engines to produce power efficiently, equipment to condition the environment of our buildings, and the systems to
use and control these engineered products. Mechanical engineers are involved in solving problems by originating
design concepts, developing products and processes of manufacture, and designing hardware and the systems
needed to satisfy society’s demands. Mechanical engineers work in virtually all industries.
 
The study of mechanical engineering requires a basic understanding of mathematics, chemistry, physics, and the
engineering sciences. Mechanical engineering education emphasizes solid mechanics; dynamics of machines;
aerodynamics; propulsion devices; material behavior; power producing and environmental conditioning processes;
control of dynamics of machines; energy conversion; and the synthesis, development, evaluation, and optimization
of designs of devices and systems.
 
Degree Programs. The Department of Mechanical Engineering offers the B.E., M.Eng., M.S., and Ph.D. in mechanical
engineering.

Page 224 of 1019 

manufacturing, and software packages that employ machine learning to optimize both the geometry and function of
parts and processes, have reached a level performance that enables their widespread integration throughout
manufacturing operations. Digital fabrication is the process of converting ideas to physical products through
computer-driven design and manufacturing. Every aspect of the design process can be simulated, from materials
selection to the toolpaths used to manipulate those materials. Consequently, digital fabrication technologies more
efficient manufacturing of prototypes and commercial parts. This minor is intended for students who are interested
in 3D printing, computer aided design (CAD), and product development.
 
The minor in Digital Fabrication prepares students for this area by providing both classroom and hands-on
instruction in advanced technologies used to prototype physical devices through computer-controlled design and
manufacturing. Students will learn how to scale-up production of their prototypes through both traditional and
additive-based manufacturing techniques. Students will gain experience through foundational courses for the minor
and expand their application through electives often related to their major. The Vanderbilt makerspace ecosystem
provides students in the minor with hands-on experiences that allow them to design, construct, and iterate
prototype devices using in-house state-of-the-art equipment. This laboratory component enhances the
competitiveness of students to both employers and graduate schools.

Materials have been key to the solutions to many societal problems. Many of the barriers to widespread
incorporation of alternate and renewable energy, from higher-capacity, more robust, less expensive batteries for
energy storage, to high efficiency/low cost solar devices, involve the need for new materials. Materials will play an
ever-increasing role in health care. New medical devices, drug delivery systems, and synthetic biological tissue are
just a few of the health-related applications in need of new materials for their success. In addition, materials
challenges are front and center in the ever-evolving areas of electronic devices. Engineers and scientists with
knowledge of materials science and engineering concepts are needed to address these and many more materials
challenges.
 
Materials science and engineering is an interdisciplinary program with affiliated faculty from all engineering
disciplines, as well as faculty from chemistry, and physics. Two undergraduate options involving materials science
and engineering are available. Students pursuing a B.S. in engineering science may choose a program concentration
in materials science and engineering. This option requires the student to take MSE 1500, 1500L, and 2500, and
other materials science and engineering elective courses to complete their 24 hours of engineering program
electives. Students pursuing a B.E. in an engineering discipline can earn a minor in materials science and
engineering.
 
The minor in materials science and engineering provides the student with an understanding of engineering
materials. It complements and adds to the student’s major in one of the engineering disciplines, exposing the
student to an interdisciplinary approach to problem solving. The minor program in materials science and
engineering requires 16 hours of program courses, of which 7 hours are devoted to MSE 1500, 1500L and MSE 2500.

COURSES OFFERED: NANO
 
Faculty in the School of Engineering and the College of Arts and Science offer an interdisciplinary minor in
nanoscience and nanotechnology. The minor is administered by the School of Engineering.
 
Nanoscience and nanotechnology are based on the ability to synthesize, organize, characterize, and manipulate
matter systematically at dimensions of ~1 to 100 nm, creating uniquely functional materials that differ in properties
from those prepared by traditional approaches. At these length scales, materials can take on new properties that
can be exploited in a wide range of applications such as for solar energy conversion, ultra-sensitive sensing, and
new types of vaccines. These activities require the integration of expertise from various areas of science and
engineering, often relying on methods of synthesis, fabrication, and characterization that are beyond those
encountered in an individual course of study.
 
Students who minor in nanoscience and nanotechnology learn the principles and methods used in this rapidly
growing field. Its core originates in the physical sciences by providing key approaches for describing the behavior of
matter on the nanoscale. Synthetic approaches are used to manipulate matter systematically, for creating uniquely
functional nanomaterials that can be inorganic, organic, biological, or a hybrid of these. With a third component of
characterization, a process for designing systems to have particular properties as a result of their composition and
nanoscale arrangement emerges. Students are introduced to these areas through foundational and elective courses
for the minor that are specified below, the latter of which can be selected to fulfill the degree requirements for their
major.
 
The minor in nanoscience and nanotechnology is supported by the Vanderbilt Institute of Nanoscale Science and
Engineering (VINSE) that brings together faculty from the College of Arts and Science, the School of Engineering,
and the Medical Center. A specialized laboratory facility maintained by VINSE provides students in the minor with
capstone experiences that allow them to prepare and characterize a variety of nanostructured systems using in-
house state-of-the-art instrumentation. This hands-on laboratory component enhances the attractiveness of
students to both employers and graduate schools.
 
The minor in nanoscience and nanotechnology requires a total of 15 credit hours, distributed as follows:

COURSES OFFERED: SC
 
Faculty in the School of Engineering and the College of Arts and Science offer an interdisciplinary minor in scientific
computing to help natural and social scientists and engineers acquire the ever-increasing computational skills that
such careers demand. The minor is administered by the School of Engineering. Students who complete this minor
will have a toolkit that includes programming skills useful for simulating physical, biological, and social dynamics, as
well as an understanding of how to take advantage of modern software tools to extract meaningful information from
small and large datasets.
 
Computation is now an integral part of modern science and engineering. In science, computer simulation allows the
study of natural phenomena impossible or intractable through experimental means. In engineering, computer
simulation allows the analysis and synthesis of systems too expensive, dangerous, or complex to model and build
directly. Astronomers studying the formation of massive black holes, neuroscientists studying neural networks for
human memory, mechanical engineers studying the designs of turbines and compressors, and electrical engineers
studying the reliability of electronics aboard spacecraft are united both in the computational challenges they face
and the tools and techniques they use to solve these challenges.
 
Students in the program in scientific computing are taught techniques for understanding such complex physical,
biological, and also social systems. Students are introduced to computational methods for simulating and analyzing
models of complex systems, to scientific visualization and data mining techniques needed to detect structure in
massively large multidimensional data sets, to high performance computing techniques for simulating models on
computing clusters with hundreds or thousands of parallel, independent processors and for analyzing terabytes or
more of data that may be distributed across a massive cloud or grid storage environment.
 
Scientific computing at Vanderbilt is supported by faculty and includes students from a wide range of scientific and
Page 235 of 1019 

engineering disciplines. While the content domain varies, these disciplines often require similar computational
approaches, high-performance computing resources, and skills to simulate interactions, model real-life systems, and
test competing hypotheses. Scientific computing embodies the computational tools and techniques for solving many
of the grand challenges facing science and engineering today.
 
The minor in scientific computing prepares students for advanced coursework that combines computational
approaches with a substantive area of science or engineering. It prepares students for independent study with a
faculty member on a research project. It prepares students for advanced study in graduate school. It provides skills
that will be attractive to many employers after graduation.
 
The minor in scientific computing is distinct from the minor in computer science. Scientific computing uses
computation as a tool to solve scientific and engineering problems in research and application. It is more focused on
simulation, numerical techniques, high performance computing, and higher-level methods than the minor in
computer science, which is focused on the algorithms, systems, and technologies that enable such methods to be
developed and employed.
 
The minor in scientific computing requires 15 credit hours, distributed as follows:
 
1. CS 1101 or 1103 or 1104
3 hou
2. CS 2204 (CS 2201 may be substituted for 2204 with the approval of a program director)

3. Elective courses. Three hours must come from course list A (Mathematical, Quantitative, and Data Science
Methods); three hours must come from course list B (Computational, Simulation, and Modeling Methods); and
three hours can come from either course list A or B, or from independent study (SC 3850/3851) with a faculty
member affiliated with the SC minor.

Education and Human Development at Vanderbilt
George Peabody College for Teachers, recognized for more than a century as one of the foremost independent
colleges of teacher education, merged with Vanderbilt University in the summer of 1979 to become Vanderbilt
University’s Peabody College of education and human development. Since then, Peabody College has retained its
heritage while achieving new stature as a place where world-class research is conducted and translated into
teaching, practice, policy, and service. Peabody's mission is characterized by practice-oriented academic programs,
a strong service ethic, groundbreaking research, and a pressing concern for addressing social problems in domestic
and international contexts.
 
The college’s faculty and students constitute a vibrant intellectual community answering pressing questions and
expanding knowledge about PreK–12 and higher education, including special education; psychology, especially
focused on families and children; the development of individuals and organizations; and educational administration,
leadership, and policy. Peabody College understands the preparation of researchers, teachers, and leaders as
among the most important things it does, and that building and sustaining an engaged academic community of
learners is central to achieving its mission.
 
Peabody faculty and students engage in a broad spectrum of basic and applied research to generate new
knowledge and translate that knowledge into practice. Current research findings inform classroom teaching at
Peabody in every program. Moreover, Peabody faculty bring an interdisciplinary and entrepreneurial spirit to the
research enterprise.
 
Working collaboratively, often through one of the college’s research centers, faculty and students publish and
present their findings, apply them in real-world settings, and help to shape public debate about the nature and
future of education and human development.
 
The college is devoted to enhancing opportunity in an increasingly diverse society. More than 1,900 students are
enrolled at Peabody, with more than one-third of them in post-baccalaureate graduate or professional degree
programs.
 
All teacher education programs are accredited by the Council for the Accreditation of Education Preparation (CAEP).
Counseling programs are accredited by the Council for the Accreditation of Counseling and Related Education
Programs (CACREP).
Centers and Outreach Efforts

Next Steps at Vanderbilt University
Next Steps at Vanderbilt is a four-year, nonresidential certification program for students with intellectual and
developmental disabilities, providing individualized programs of study in the areas of education, social skills, and
vocational training. Next steps is a comprehensive transition program designated by the U.S. Department of
Education. This status recognizes the program's merits and allows eligible students to apply for federal financial aid
for tuition assistance. Learn more here: https://peabody.vanderbilt.edu/nextsteps. 
Page 242 of 1019 

The Undergraduate Program
Peabody College offers the bachelor of science with majors in elementary education, secondary education, special
education, cognitive studies, child development, child studies, and human and organizational development. These
undergraduate programs are designed to prepare students for professional careers in their chosen fields. Programs
for Peabody students include course work in a Liberal Education Core, a professional core, a major area of
specialization, and electives. Peabody also provides professional education courses for College of Arts and Science
students who want to prepare for teacher licensure.
 
The bachelor of science is granted on the basis of 120 semester hours of college work with a final grade point
average of 2.000, and completion of the Liberal Education Core and the requirements of the major.
Liberal Education Core Program
In pursuit of breadth of knowledge and understanding about the world in which they live, all undergraduates
complete the requirements of the Liberal Education Core program. This Liberal Education Core component of all
Peabody undergraduate majors is intended to provide students with a solid foundation in the arts and sciences. The
core curriculum incorporates the study of human conditions that are universal. The Liberal Education Core involves
study in the following areas:
 
Communications. The study of language in its written and spoken forms.
Mathematics/Quantitative Analysis. The study of mathematical concepts and procedures.
Social Sciences. The study of the past—both the heritage of the United States and the more global human story.
Humanities. The study of the universal language of the arts.
Natural Sciences. The study of scientific process and interrelationships among the sciences.
 
Through the study of these universal subjects, concepts, and modes of thought, students gain a broad foundation
transferable to their futures. They will continue to grow within society and the classroom and will look at problems
from different perspectives while maintaining curiosity.
 
Courses identified to fulfill the Liberal Education Core requirement for each undergraduate major are listed in
Peabody’s Undergraduate Handbook (https://peabody.vanderbilt.edu/office-academic-services/). 
 
Courses used to satisfy these core requirements may also be counted toward the fulfillment of requirements in an
academic major. Special topics courses are ordinarily not acceptable for meeting Liberal Education Core
requirements. These courses require prior approval as substitute courses. Independent study courses are not
acceptable for meeting Liberal Education Core requirements.
 
Transfer students may use credits from other colleges to fulfill Peabody’s Liberal Education Core requirements if the
credits are equivalent to the courses offered at Vanderbilt. For transfer students, credits are evaluated when the
student enrolls at Peabody in order to determine which transfer courses will substitute for Peabody’s Liberal
Education Core requirements. Requirements still to be fulfilled will be noted at that time.

Peabody offers programs leading to teacher licensure in the following areas: elementary (grades K–5), and
secondary education (grades 6–12) with endorsement in English, math, biology, chemistry, physics, earth science,
history, and political science. (Added endorsements are available also in economics, psychology, and sociology for
those who will have a history endorsement.) An added endorsement program also is available in English as a Second
Language (grades PreK–12). All of these programs are offered by the Department of Teaching and Learning.
 
Special education–interventionist (LD/BD for grades K–8 or 6–12) or comprehensive (multiple/severe for grades K–
12) are offered by the Department of Special Education.
 
Vanderbilt’s Blair School of Music and Peabody College offer a program for students interested in teacher licensure
with endorsement in the following: (1) instrumental/general music (grades K–12), or (2) vocal/general music (grades
K–12). Blair students complete the first part of the program as part of the bachelor of music degree and apply during
the senior year to continue into the master of education degree for a final year of professional education.
 
Students seeking licensure may enroll in Peabody College, the College of Arts and Science, or the Blair School of
Music. In all cases, most of the liberal arts course work is taken in the College of Arts and Science, and the
professional education course work is taken at Peabody College.
 
All students completing a teacher education program at Vanderbilt are strongly advised to apply for a license in
Tennessee whether or not they plan to teach in this state. In addition, licensure is available by application in other
states. The student is responsible for applying for Tennessee licensure through the Office of Teacher Licensure. Each
state has its own application forms and procedures for licensure; information is available on the Office of Teacher
Licensure website: peabody.vanderbilt.edu/teacher-licensure/. 
 
Licensure requirements continue to undergo revision. Students must meet licensure requirements in effect at the
time of their program completion, which may be different from requirements in effect at the time they entered the
program. Each year, teacher education students should consult the current Vanderbilt Undergraduate Catalog or the
Peabody Undergraduate Handbook. The website peabody.vanderbilt.edu/teacher-licensure/ provides additional
information.
Security Clearance
As part of the Peabody background check process you are required to pass a fingerprint criminal background check
by the beginning of your first semester. Visit https://peabody.vanderbilt.edu/criminal-background-clearance for
detailed information.
Degree Audits
Electronic degree audits enable students and faculty advisers to track each student’s progress in the degree
program at Peabody. The departmental handbooks describe access to and use of online Peabody major degree
audits to view program requirements recognized as “met” or “unmet” at any time in the student’s program. The
degree audit also denotes permissions for waivers or course substitutions. Degree audits are managed in the
Peabody Office of Academic Services.

Students seeking teacher licensure must be approved by each department through which licensure is sought.
Secondary licensure candidates should contact an adviser or the director of undergraduate studies in the
appropriate Arts and Science department(s) to be informed of any specific departmental requirements or standards.
There are two points in each teacher education program when undergraduates must complete applications for
screenings by departmental faculty. Screening requirements continue to undergo revision and are subject to
change. Students must meet screening requirements in effect at the time of their application, which may be
different from requirements stated below. Screening reviews, described below, are important checkpoints that allow
successful students to   advance in the program. Attainment of 2.75 (4.0) cumulative grade point average and
completion of required courses do not automatically qualify a student for continuation in the program.
 
Faculty evaluation of a student’s qualifications for continuation in a teacher education program include academic,
performance, and disposition factors such as the following:
1. Dependability (as evidenced by good attendance in classes and practica and the completion of required
assignments and procedures on time)
2. Professional and ethical behavior (honesty, acceptance of responsibility, emotional maturity, etc.)
3. Attitude and interpersonal skills (including the ability to work with children and with peers)
4. Academic competence (It is possible for a student to meet minimum grade point requirements and pass all
courses and still have specific academic weaknesses which might cause denial of screening applications)
5. Teaching competence (as evidenced by successful completion of practica requirements). It is possible for a
student to meet minimum grade point requirements and pass all courses and still have specific performance
weaknesses which might cause denial of screening applications.
These criteria rest on the professional judgment of faculty members. Whether a student meets them or not is
determined by a vote of appropriate faculty. Undergraduate students seeking secondary education licensure must
be approved by the Department of Teaching and Learning faculty and also by the faculty of College of Arts and
Science department(s) for the Arts and Science major(s).
 
Screening deadlines are October 1 and February 1. Undergraduates must apply for Screening I during spring of the
sophomore year or fall of the junior year. Screening II must be done in the fall of the senior year, restricting
undergraduate student teaching to the spring of the senior year. Deadlines are firm; late applications will not be
accepted. The Screening I and II application form should be submitted online no later than the deadline. (NOTE:
Screening II applications require additional documents when submitted. See specific requirements with the
application.)
 
Students will be notified of results of the faculty vote at the end of the screening semester. In instances where there
is a negative decision, the student wishing to appeal must do so in writing to the chairperson(s) of the department(s)
denying the application. If the initial decision is upheld and the student wishes to continue the appeal, a written
petition should be filed with the Administrative Committee of Peabody College.
Screening I (Formal Admission to an Undergraduate Teacher Education Program)
Each student seeking teacher licensure must be formally admitted to the teacher education program(s) by
completing an online application for Screening I review by the faculty of the department(s) in which endorsement(s)
is/are sought. Candidates normally apply for Screening I during spring of the sophomore year or fall of the junior
year, depending on their program area (candidates should consult their department handbook for timelines in their
program area). Deadlines are February 1 in the spring and October 1 in the fall. Students who transfer more than 60
hours to Vanderbilt from another institution must apply for admission to the teacher education program by the
screening deadline of their second semester at Vanderbilt.
 
An initial screening review by the faculty will occur soon after the Screening I deadline. If there are concerns noted,
the student will be counseled. The final faculty review and decision will be done toward the end of the semester.
 
Page 245 of 1019 

Criteria for Screening I (formal admission to teacher education) are:
A. Specific Academic Criteria
1. Test scores (SAT composite score of 780 or ACT 21, OR passing scores on the Praxis I Core Academic
Skills for Educators) or university credit in reading, writing, and mathematics courses.
2. Minimum cumulative grade point average of 2.75 (4-point scale)
3. Successful completion of at least two of the required professional education courses as defined by the
program area with a minimum grade of C+
4. Department interview
B. Specific Faculty Evaluative Criteria: The faculty will consider the disposition criteria of dependability,
professional and ethical behavior, attitude and interpersonal skills, and teaching competence as itemized at
the beginning of the Screening section.
Screening II (Admission to Student Teaching)
Admission to Student Teaching is not automatic when prerequisite course work and field experiences have been
completed. All students must submit the online Screening II application by October 1 in the fall of the senior year. At
the time of screening application, the student should be enrolled in any remaining prerequisite courses. No course
work may be taken during the semester of student teaching and seminar.
 
After an initial review in the Office of Teacher Licensure, the Screening II application and other submitted materials
will be considered by departmental faculty according to the following criteria for Screening II approval to student
teach:
A. Specific Academic Criteria
1. Formal admission to a teacher education program granted (completion of Screening I)
2. First semester senior standing (for student teaching in the spring of the senior year)
3. Successful completion (C+ or above) of all courses required and prerequisite to student teaching as
defined by the program area
4. Minimum cumulative grade point average of 2.75 (4.0 scale)
5. Satisfactory performance (C+ or above) in course work in areas in which teacher licensure is sought
6. Successful completion of Standard First Aid and CPR training (attach certificate copies to the Screening
II application)
B. Specific Faculty Evaluative Criteria: The faculty will consider the disposition criteria of dependability,
professional and ethical behavior, attitude and interpersonal skills, and teaching competence as itemized at
the beginning of the Screening section.
Each Screening II application requires additional documents, depending on the program. A copy of first aid and CPR
verification of training completed within the previous two years must be submitted to the Office of Teacher
Licensure by the October 1 or February 1 deadline. In addition, some programs have additional requirements that
are prerequisite to Screening II application. Students should consult departmental handbooks. Screening II
applicants who are approved to student teach will receive notification of their student teaching placements no later
than during the Student Teacher Orientation at the beginning of the student teaching semester.
 
Students who have passed Screening II are assigned two specific student teaching placements in the Nashville area.
Student Teaching
Vanderbilt students seeking teacher licensure must successfully complete a 15-week semester of full-time student
teaching in two different grade levels in Nashville area public schools and must be recommended for licensure by
the supervisors of student teaching and departmental faculty. Student teaching may be done only in the spring
semester. Prior to the start of student teaching, all prerequisite courses must have been completed, the cumulative
GPA must be at least 2.75, and the appropriate departmental faculties must have voted to approve the candidate for
student teaching during the previous semester as part of the Screening II application process. The Tennessee State
Department of Education and Metropolitan Nashville Public Schools prohibit student teachers from taking courses
during student teaching. See the departmental Undergraduate Handbook for details.
Application for Teacher Licensure and University Recommendation for Licensure
All students completing the teacher education program at Vanderbilt are strongly advised to apply for a license in
Tennessee whether or not they plan to teach in this state. In addition, licensure is available in most other states.
Page 246 of 1019 

The student is responsible for applying for Tennessee licensure through the Office of Teacher Licensure. Each state
has its own application forms and procedures for licensure; information is available on the Office of Teacher
Licensure website.
 
To be licensed through Vanderbilt’s teacher education program, a graduate must earn a positive licensure
recommendation from the university. The university’s decision to recommend a candidate is based upon the
following:
1. Maintaining the grade point average required for admission to the teacher education program (2.75 on a 4.0
scale).
2. For Tennessee licensure, achieving the state minimum score on all required parts of the PRAXIS II Series and
edTPA (scores must be sent to the Vanderbilt Office of Teacher Licensure–code R 1871, and the Tennessee
Department of Education–code R 8190).*
3. Receiving a positive recommendation from the student’s department as a result of the student teaching
experience (Pass in student teaching does not guarantee a favorable recommendation).
*Testing requirements are changing almost annually; check instructions in the Office of Teacher Licensure or at
ets.org/praxis/ before registering to take the exam.

Special Program in Peabody College
Peabody Scholars Program
First-year students who achieve academic distinction during their first semester at Vanderbilt are invited to apply to
the Peabody Scholars Program. The Peabody Scholars Honors Program was established to offer particularly
promising undergraduates at Peabody College opportunities for intellectual adventure, community service, and
research. Emphasizing a theme of personal, professional, and civic creativity, the program is designed to foster
students’ potential by offering breadth through exposing students to a variety of academic and social experiences
and depth by engaging in service-learning and independent research.
 
To graduate with honors through Peabody Scholars, scholars need to earn 24 points within the program. Scholars
earn points from a series of required components as well as optional enrichment programming. All freshman
Peabody Scholars participate in a 3-credit-hour Honors Seminar during the spring semester of their first year. In the
sophomore year, scholars work together on a meaningful immersive service project in the local community. Each
Peabody Scholar is offered a summer stipend (between sophomore and junior years) to support engagement in an
individual service or intensive research project (either domestic or abroad). In the junior year, scholars engage in
independent research projects with a faculty member. Senior scholars participate in both  scholarly and cultural
events. The Peabody Scholars Program also offers professional development, networking, and mentoring. The full
list of current programming is available on the program website. In sum, the Peabody Scholars Program offers a rich
array of enrichment experiences and opportunities.
 
Peabody freshmen may apply for the Peabody Scholars Program in the fall of their first semester at Vanderbilt.
Selections will be made prior to the beginning of the spring semester. To be accepted into the program, students
must have a first-semester GPA of 3.6. To remain in good standing in the program, students must maintain a
minimum grade point average of 3.0. Further information on the Peabody Scholars Program may be obtained from
Professor Megan Saylor in the Psychology and Human Development Department.

Major in Child Development
The child development major is designed for students who wish to study children (infancy through adolescence) and
the family, cultural, peer, school, and neighborhood contexts in which they live. The major is designed to provide a
strong background in the social and behavioral sciences related to child development, a focused understanding of
the scientific study of children and the contexts in which they develop, and opportunities for supervised and
independent research on aspects of child development in ways that enable students to link theories and prior
research to research design and data on children’s development. The major is excellent preparation for graduate
study in selected social science and professional fields (e.g., psychology, medicine, nursing, education, public
policy) and offers an excellent complementary (or second) major for undergraduate students simultaneously
pursuing a major in cognitive studies, elementary education, human and organizational development, or special
education.
 
The child development curriculum is designed to ensure that students develop a background in the liberal arts and
sciences; a clear understanding of the theories, major research findings, and research methods central to the field of
child development; and an area of focus or expertise in child development. Development of background in the
liberal arts and sciences occurs within the context of the Liberal Education Core, composed of required and elective
courses in communications, humanities, mathematics, natural sciences, and social sciences. A clear understanding
of theory and research central to the field is developed through the major core courses. These include an overview
of child development, courses focused on the domains of psychological processes central to human development
(cognition; social and personality development), courses related to major epochs of child development (infancy and
adolescence), and courses devoted to the major research methodologies in the field (experimental, observational,
psychometric). Students select an area of concentration (major elective area) to complement the field as a whole.
Page 254 of 1019 

Honors Program
The Honors Program in child development offers qualified majors the opportunity to conduct individual research
projects in collaboration with faculty members. This research experience culminates in the writing and public
presentation of a senior thesis. Students who major in child development are eligible to apply for the Honors
Program at the end of their sophomore year if they have an overall grade point average of at least 3.2 and at least a
3.2 in child development courses.
 
Students who complete the program successfully and who have a final grade point average of at least 3.2 will
receive Honors or Highest Honors in child development. The program should substantially aid those intending to do
graduate work. More specific information concerning admission to and the requirements of the Honors Program is
available from the director of the Honors Program, the director of undergraduate studies, or the department
education coordinator.
Curriculum
Students take a minimum of 120 hours, distributed as follows:
Liberal Education Core Requirements. Minimum 40 hours.
The Liberal Education Core is composed of required course work from the areas of Communications, Humanities,
Mathematics, Science, Cultural Studies, Social Science, and Electives. Listings of all courses that may fulfill these
areas are located online in the Peabody Undergraduate Handbook (http://peabody.vanderbilt.edu/admin-
offices/oas/downloads.php).
 
A score of 5 on the AP Statistics exam will waive students from the Statistics Liberal Education Core requirement
(applied to all PSYHD majors). A score of 5 on the AP Statistics exam will serve as a pre-requisite in all places that
PSY-PC 2110 currently serves as a pre-requisite.
Writing Requirement
See the "Writing Requirement" section of the general Peabody academic policy section of the Undergraduate
Catalog.
 
NOTE: First-year Seminars (courses numbered 1111) offered through the College of Arts and Science and the Blair
School of Music may count as writing intensive courses. Peabody freshmen may only register for First-year Seminars
when open registration begins.
Major Requirements. 30 hours.
Students take a minimum of 30 hours in child development. The core consists of seven courses (21 hours) in
developmental areas, epochs, and methods, and a minimum of three additional courses (9 hours) in an elective area

Second Major or Electives. 50 hours (or less if additional hours are earned in the Liberal Education Core, Major Core, or Major Elective Area).
Major in Child Studies
Peabody has long had great strength in the area of child studies. The 36-hour interdisciplinary major in child studies
draws on courses from psychology, education, special education, and human and organizational development. The
major is excellent pre-professional preparation for students interested in graduate school in psychology or
education, in law (e.g., child and family advocacy), or in various health related areas (e.g., medicine, nursing)
involving children. It  is also appropriate for students who are interested in gaining a broader understanding of
children and families in contemporary society. The major areas covered are: developmental psychology; learning;
research methods; language and literacy; and families, community, and diversity.
Honors Program
The Honors Program in child studies offers qualified majors the opportunity to conduct individual research projects
in collaboration with faculty members. This research experience culminates in the writing and public presentation of
a senior thesis. Students who major in child studies are eligible to apply for the Honors Program at the end of their

Major in Cognitive Studies
The cognitive studies major is designed for students who wish to become active inquirers into the processes by
Page 259 of 1019 

which people learn to think, solve problems, and reason. The major encourages the development of flexible
reasoning and problem-solving skills that are useful in a wide variety of endeavors. The major is excellent
preparation for graduate study in the social and behavioral sciences as well as for areas (such as medicine and law)
that place importance on inquiry and clear thinking.
 
The curriculum is planned to ensure that students receive a strong background in both science and the liberal arts,
with an emphasis on problem solving and complex decision making. The courses in the core curriculum focus on
various aspects of human cognition, including communication, cognitive development, basic cognitive processes,
applications of theories of knowledge, and sociocultural aspects of learning. Students are encouraged to consult
their advisers about pursuing a second major or developing an area of concentration that is consistent with their
career plans. The major also emphasizes an appreciation of the scientific method and the research process;
numerous opportunities exist to pursue independent study in close collaboration with faculty members.
 
Leadership and success in our society will depend increasingly on one’s ability to process complex information,
solve difficult problems using systematic analysis, and facilitate the learning of others. The knowledge and
experience gained by students in cognitive studies will allow them to be full participants in the society of learners
who represent the future.
Honors Program
The Honors Program in cognitive studies offers qualified majors the opportunity to conduct individual research
projects in collaboration with faculty members. This research experience culminates in the writing and public
presentation of a senior thesis. Students who major in cognitive studies are eligible to apply for the Honors Program
at the end of their sophomore year if they have an overall grade point average of at least 3.2 and a 3.2 in cognitive
studies courses. Students who complete the program successfully and who have a final grade point average of at
least 3.2 will receive Honors or Highest Honors in cognitive studies. The program should substantially aid those
intending to do graduate work. More specific information concerning admission to and the requirements of the
Honors Program is available from the director of the Honors Program, the director of undergraduate studies, or the

The Minor in Quantitative Methods
Quantitative skills are highly valued in a variety of fields. Training provided by the quantitative methods minor can
provide a competitive edge on the job market or for future graduate study. Many advances in quantitative methods
used in the social sciences and education are not covered in standard undergraduate introductory statistics courses.
This minor exposes students to more recent developments in quantitative methods with concrete applications to
practice. The quantitative methods minor helps students become better consumers and producers of scientific
research. Students will have the opportunity to learn from leading experts in the statistical analysis of social science
data.
Structure of the Minor
Prerequisite for the minor is completion of the introductory statistics sequence that is already required by the
undergraduate psychology majors. This sequence is:
 
PSY-PC 2110 or PSY 2100 or ECON 1500 or MATH 2810 or a 5 on AP Stat Exam
And
PSY-PC 2120. Statistical Analysis (3 hours)
 
The quantitative methods minor is an 18-hour minor. The 18 hours include both PSY-PC-2110 (or PSY 2100 or ECON
1500 or MATH 2810 or a 5 on AP Stat Exam) and PSY-PC 2120, and these serve as prerequisite courses for the
electives. Following completion of these prerequisite courses (6 hours; required), the minor requires four additional
courses (12 hours; electives). Any four courses offered by the Quantitative Methods program are applicable. At
most, three hours of directed research/independent study can count toward the minor. Students with interest in
directed research/independent study can contact individual quantitative methods faculty directly.
 
Courses that would satisfy the elective requirements (pick 4):
PSY-PC 3722. Psychometric Methods
PSY-PC 3724. Psychometrics
PSY-PC 3727. Modern Robust Statistical Methods

Major in Human and Organizational Development
The Human and Organizational Development (HOD) major prepares students to address complex social problems in
organizations and communities. The HOD curriculum challenges students to view human problems and their
solutions in organizations and communities. The HOD curriculum challenges students to view human problems and
their solutions as embedded in broader social ecological systems. HOD coursework draws on a range of disciplinary
perspectives (e.g., psychology, organizational studies, sociology, political science, anthropology, geography,
economics), and explores societal issues across distinct levels of analysis (e.g., individual, group, organization,
community, policy, international). HOD coursework engages students through active learning approaches involving
teams, simulations, case studies, field experiences, and interaction with academic researchers and professionals in
the field. These experiences support the development of the following HOD Core Competencies that will help
students succeed in people-oriented organizational roles:
 
1. Written communication - with emphasis on developing a clear, concise, expository style and mastering the
practical forms used in professional situations.
2. Oral presentation - with emphasis on making informative and persuasive presentations with the effective use
of technology and media.
3. Analytic and critical thinking - with emphasis on data-driven analysis, creativity, and systems thinking to
recognize, define and work to solve personal, professional, organizational, and social problems.
4. Interpersonal communication - with emphasis on inquiry, advocacy, leadership, and conflict resolution skills.
5. Collaborative work behaviors - with emphasis on motivating others, managing talent, and teamwork.
HOD requirements consist of the Peabody Liberal Education Core and HOD Major Requirements, plus the successful
completion of an HOD capstone experience.
 
Peabody Liberal Education Core 
The Liberal Education Core provides students with a strong liberal arts foundation. It is composed of required
coursework from the areas of Communications, Humanities, Quantitative Analysis, Natural Science, Social Science,
and Electives. Listings of all courses that may fulfill these areas are located online in the Peabody Undergraduate
Handbook (peabody.vanderbilt.edu/admin-offices/oas/downloads.php). In addition, students must complete two
writing intensive courses. See the "Writing Requirement" section of the general Peabody academic policy section of
Page 274 of 1019 

the Undergraduate Catalog.
 
HOD Major Requirements
 
Human and Organizational Development Professional Core (15 hours): The HOD Core introduces students to
ecological systems thinking, theories of human, group, community, organizational, and policy development, and
quantitative & qualitative approaches to research and problem solving. Professional core courses are designed to
help students:
1. Understand the basic principles and typical patterns of human development across the life span and use this
knowledge to understand their own behavior and the behavior of others;
2. Understand the principles of group dynamics and use this knowledge to provide leadership and facilitate
decision making in small group and team settings;
3. Understand theories of organizations and apply them to the solution of organizational problems;
4. Understand the critical role that community contexts play in shaping individual, group, and organizational
well-being;
5. Apply quantitative and qualitative methods of systematic inquiry and analysis;
6. Understand public policy processes and the factors that influence policy making;
7. Understand the ethical dimensions of personal and organizational decisions and apply this understanding to
analyze social issues and make professional and personal decisions;
8. Develop enhanced skills of synthesis including the ability to integrate ideas from various sources and to
design innovative programs.
9. Understand and engage in practices and policies that ensure inclusion of diverse populations and
perspectives.
The program design will endow you with the skills and knowledge needed to succeed in a people-oriented
organizational role.
 
Human and Organizational Development Domains: Domain courses build on the foundational courses in the HOD
Professional Core. Students will choose courses that will help them develop breadth and depth across levels of
analysis in topic areas of interest. Students must complete two courses in each of the following three domains:
 
   Individual/Interpersonal Domain: Courses in this domain delve deeper into personal and professional development
and explore topics, including but not limited to, leadership, professional ethics, youth development, professional
   development, and mental health and well-being. Through these courses students will develop professional skills in
data management, research, individual and team leadership, human-centered design, and interpersonal conflict
resolution.
 
   Organizational/Group Domain: Courses in this domain explore recent advances in organizational theory and
innovative management strategies in for-profit, non-profit, and public sector organizations in the U.S. and
international contexts.    Course topics include, but are not limited to organizational effectiveness, organizational
change management, and social entrepreneurship. Courses use case studies and practical application to prepare
students to engage organizational    challenges in an increasingly complex and dynamic world.
 
   Community/Policy Domain: Courses in this domain invite students to critically examine the causes and
consequences of complex social problems from a systems perspective and explore community- and policy-level
approaches to change    and intervention. Courses address a range of local and global topics and consider the
diverse perspectives of marginalized communities. These topics include, but are not limited to educational equity,
environmental justice and    sustainability, violence prevention, and economic development, as well as  poverty-
related challenges such as fair and affordable housing, employment, health disparities, transportation,
neighborhood safety, and resource provision.
 
Human and Organizational Development Capstone: (12 credit hours/Summer or 15 credit hours/Fall or Spring
Page 275 of 1019 

semesters): The Capstone is the immersive learning academic semester for junior and senior students in the Human
and Organizational Development (HOD) major at Vanderbilt University. Successful completion of the HOD Capstone
semester satisfies the Vanderbilt Immersion requirement. The Capstone is designed for students to apply the core
HOD coursework and develop data-driven and research-grounded contributions to address human problems in
organizations and communities. The HOD capstone requires 28 hours a week, at least 30% in person, fully in person
preferred with the confirmed site and a weekly 3-hour seminar. The experience is possible in fall, spring or summer
semesters. The HOD Capstone office has preexisting relationships with sites in Nashville, Chicago, New York City,
San Francisco, Washington D.C. and London, England. However, students are not limited to these cities.
 
The HOD philosophy emphasizes the importance of connecting academic knowledge and theories to professional
practice. HOD undergraduate core requirements offer an applied liberal arts education that will endow students with
the skills and knowledge needed to succeed in organizations and communities. The capstone semester is designed
to provide students the opportunity to synthesize the HOD coursework and learning experiences in an
organizational context - which is central to the foundation of the applied learning experience and mission of our
degree.
HOD majors (juniors and seniors) who have successfully completed the HOD 4949 Capstone Design requirements,
approved for the HOD Capstone by the HOD Capstone Office, and completed the HOD core class prerequisites
including HOD 1250, 1300, 2100, 2400 (not required for students who entered Summer 2023 or later), 2500, and
2700 are eligible to register for HOD 4950, 4951, 4952 and 4953.
 
Students enroll in a semester-long course, HOD 4949 in the fall to design a spring capstone and enroll in
spring to design a summer or fall capstone. Note HOD 4949 Capstone Design is not offered in the
summer. The capstone design semester is an opportunity for students to explore, develop and confirm a successful
capstone experience. They partner with the HOD Capstone team for mentoring, coaching, connection events, and a
variety of campus partners to confirm their capstone site. The capstone semester provides a variety of opportunities
for students to integrate and apply earlier coursework in a civic/professional, research, international or creative
partnership. Students design their capstone to align with their field of interest. They select opportunities that
provide valuable applied work experiences, build professional development competencies, and help launch their
post-graduation careers. During the HOD capstone semester, students enroll in four courses that accompany their
capstone experience: HOD 4950 (P/F - 3 credit hours during summer; 6 hours during fall or spring) Organizational
Partnership, HOD 4951 (3 hours) Critical Reflexivity and Systems Thinking, HOD 4952 (3 hours) Mapping Future
Development, and HOD 4953 (3 hours) Analysis and Contribution. For additional information on the HOD Capstone
visit our website HERE.

Honors Program
The HOD Honors Program is designed for highly motivated students who want to pursue intensive research. It offers
outstanding undergraduate HOD majors an opportunity to become involved in research teams with professors and
graduate students. The program will help students develop skills in empirical research methods, writing, and
presentation to provide a firm foundation for advanced graduate or professional training. The HOD Honors Programs
requires a serious time commitment to a research project.
 
Application: Students may apply for the honors program at any time from the second semester of their sophomore
year to the summer before their senior year. The application must be approved by the faculty member with whom
the student will work, and will outline the nature of the research project, which will ordinarily be an extension of the
faculty member’s ongoing research. Students must have completed HOD 1250, HOD 1300, HOD 2100, HOD 2500,
and a college statistics course and have an overall GPA of at least 3.6. This minimum GPA must be maintained to
graduate with honors.
 
Applications will be evaluated by the HOD Honors Director, who will decide on admission, taking into consideration
the numbers of applicants.
 
Requirements: Upon admission students will complete two (not necessarily back-to-back) semesters of honors
seminar (for six total hours of credit), which satisfy one course in two HOD domains of the student's choosing, plus
the writing course requirement. In the course, they will learn advanced research methods. In addition to the honors
seminar, the student will work with the faculty sponsor on research for up to ten hours per week. Students must
complete a pilot study (first semester) and an empirical (quantitative or qualitative) honors thesis (second semester)
that is approved by two faculty readers, and orally present both pilot study and thesis. Although not required,
honors projects may be coordinated with the HOD Capstone with permission of the instructor, the student's Honor's
advisor, and HOD Capstone Director, and may be taken in the same semester as Capstone. Students are additionally
encouraged to attend departmental colloquia and to take at least one graduate course in their area of interest.
 
Awards of departmental Honors in HOD will depend on successful completion of the course and the thesis. Highest
Honors and Best HOD Honors Thesis may be awarded by vote of the Honors Committee.

Note: Students who want to double-major in Human and Organizational Development and Early Childhood
Education, Elementary Education or Special Education must take H&OD as their second major, due to state teacher
licensure regulations.
Human and Organizational Studies
Human and Organizational Studies (HOS) is an alternative major that is available only to Human and Organizational
Development (HOD) majors who, due to extenuating circumstances, are unable to complete the required HOD
capstone internship after it is too late to complete a new first major. This alternative is initiated and approved by the
director of the HOD Capstone Program and the Director of Undergraduate Studies for HOD. In lieu of the HOD
Capstone, students complete 30 hours of upper-level approved HOD courses to meet the major's 45-hour degree
requirement.
 
Students must complete the Human and Organizational Development liberal education core, the writing
requirement, and earn a minimum of 120 hours and a 2.0 cumulative GPA.

The undergraduate program in special education prepares students to work with persons with disabilities and leads
to licensure in special education. Students pursue an interdisciplinary major in exceptional learning with emphasis in
one of the two specialty areas: high-incidence disabilities (interventionist program K-8 and/or 6-12) or multiple and
severe disabilities (comprehensive program). This major can be combined with other majors such as cognitive
studies, child development, or majors in the College of Arts and Science. The program is field- oriented and problem
centered, with most professional courses requiring direct involvement with individuals with disabilities. Beginning in
Page 282 of 1019 

the freshman year, students observe and work in a variety of educational settings in local schools and in classrooms
off campus.
 
Vanderbilt students seeking teacher licensure must apply through the Office of Teacher Licensure at Vanderbilt and
must meet licensure requirements in effect at the time of their graduation, which may be different from licensure
requirements in effect at the time they entered the program. Each year, teacher licensure candidates should consult
the current Vanderbilt Undergraduate Catalog, the Undergraduate Guide to Teacher Licensure published by the
Vanderbilt Office of Teacher Licensure, and the Undergraduate Handbook published by the Office of Administration
and Records.
Honors Program
The Honors Program in Special Education offers qualified majors the opportunity to gain experience in conducting
research in collaboration with a faculty mentor. This experience culminates in the writing and presentation of a
senior project. Students who major in special education are eligible to apply for the Honors Program in the spring of
their sophomore year if they have an overall grade point average of at least 3.5. Students who are accepted into the
Honors Program, successfully complete the program, and maintain the required grade point averages, will graduate
with Honors in Special Education. Specific information concerning admission to and the requirements of the Honors
Program in Special Education is available from Professor Andrea Capizzi, director of undergraduate studies for the
Department of Special Education. Students should be aware that participation in the Honors Program is quite time-
intensive and represents a substantial commitment of effort across at least three semesters. Therefore, potential
participants must carefully consider whether they are able to, and want to, devote the required time and energy to
this program.
B.S. Degree Requirements
Specializations are available in high-incidence disabilities/interventionist (grades K–8/6–12 interventionist licensure),
and severe disabilities (grades K–12 comprehensive licensure). Total hours will vary depending on the area of
specialization.
 
Students take a minimum of 120 hours, distributed as follows:
Liberal Education Core Requirements. Minimum 60 hours.
The Liberal Education Core is composed of required course work from the areas of Communications, Humanities,
Mathematics, Science, Cultural Studies, Social Science, and Electives. Listings of all courses that may fulfill these
areas are located online in the Peabody Undergraduate Handbook (https://peabody.vanderbilt.edu/admin-

COURSES OFFERED: ANTH, KICH
 
Anthropology is the study of human diversity in all times and places. It brings together perspectives from the
sciences and humanities to illuminate different aspects of the human past, the human body, and contemporary
social life. Global perspectives, fieldwork and experiential learning, and concerns with ethics, justice, and social well-
being are hallmarks of anthropology.
 
Vanderbilt’s program has a strong research focus on Latin America and historically marginalized groups, especially
indigenous people and descendants of the African diaspora.
 
Students majoring in anthropology take courses in several subfields, each of which looks at humanity from a
different perspective. Cultural anthropology examines the relationships, beliefs, values, and political-economic
practices that shape individual behavior, community life, and power in modern societies. Archaeology studies
societies through their material remains, enabling long-term perspectives on the human past as well as connections
to present-day descendant communities. Linguistics explores relations between language and culture. Biological
anthropology examines topics such as community health in the past and present, forensic science, genetics,
evolution, human biology, and bioethics. Courses cluster around themes of cross-cultural health, biology, food, and
medical systems; inequality, power, and social-political relations; material culture, human-environment relations,
and spatial analysis; religion and politics; and worldviews, language, and cognition. Many courses are
interdisciplinary in nature, with connections to programs such as Biology; Earth and Environmental Science;
Medicine, Health, and Society; Human and Organizational Development; History; Classics and Mediterranean
Studies; Sociology; Jewish Studies; African American and Diaspora Studies; Latin American Studies; Asian Studies,
and others, and attracts students from all four Undergraduate colleges. Unless indicated otherwise in the course
description, anthropology courses have no prerequisites and are open to all majors and non-majors.
 
Knowledge of the diversity of human histories and lifeways is vital to imagining alternative paths to a better society.
Anthropology develops this knowledge through experiential learning that challenges students to go beyond the
familiar, to see, understand, create, and interact in new ways. This preparation is useful in all professional careers
that involve understanding human behavior, working with people from different backgrounds, analyzing complex
information, and thinking holistically about the conditions that shape people’s lives.
Program of Concentration in Anthropology
The major in anthropology requires completion of at least 30 credit hours of course work, as follows:
1. 6 credit hours. Two 1000-level surveys selected from the subfields of anthropology: 1101 (Cultural
Page 293 of 1019 

Anthropology), 1201 (Archaeology), 1301 (Biological Anthropology), 1601 (Linguistic Anthropology). A course
in a third subfield is strongly recommended (in consultation with the adviser).
2. 3 credit hours. A seminar on anthropological theory (2101 or 2102). The seminar may not be used to count
toward theme credit below.
3. 3 credit hours. A course on anthropological methods; this class may not count towards the theme
requirement. Courses that satisfy the methods requirement include 2211, 2601, 2602, 2602W, 2603, 3120,

Honors Program
The Honors Program in Anthropology allows exceptional undergraduate students to undertake independent research
on a topic in consultation and mentorship with faculty members. This program is open to all Anthropology majors
with junior standing who have a 3.3 GPA in all general University courses and Anthropology courses who are
approved for acceptance into the Honors Program by Department faculty. Completion of the program requires:
1. 3-6 credit hours in ANTH 4998 (Honors Research, select the section under your adviser's name), evaluated by
the Honors Thesis Adviser, generally in the fall semester of the student's senior year. If the student plans to
graduate in December, they may take 4998 in the spring semester.
2. 3-6 credit hours in ANTH 4999 (Honors Thesis), evaluated by Honors Thesis Adviser, generally in the spring
semester of the student's senior year. If the student plans to graduate in December, they may take 4999 in
the fall.
3. Submission of a written thesis, evaluated by the student's Honors Committee.
4. Oral presentation of the thesis (15-20 mins.), which includes invited guests and members of the department,
evaluated by the student's Honors Committee.
5. Oral examination (defense) of the thesis, administered by the student's Honors Committee, usually after the
Page 294 of 1019 

public presentation.
The honors thesis hours are expected to be in excess of the 30 hours required for the Major in Anthropology and are
typically done in the student's senior year. This timeline may be modified after consultation with the thesis adviser,
Departmental Director of the Honors Program, and Faculty approval.
 
Students meeting these requirements receive Honors or High Honors in Anthropology, depending on the qualify of
their thesis, grades in anthropology courses, and examination results. Successful Departmental Honors students will
receive a Vanderbilt diploma that records Honors or High Honors in Anthropology.

COURSES OFFERED: ARTS
 
Courses in art are offered in a variety of media, which provide wide-ranging methods and perspectives. Our courses
emphasize creative and critical approaches to learning. The department of art offers a rigorous, socially minded,
and research-driven curriculum. Students engage in an immersive laboratory of fearless experimentation and
challenge the rapidly expanding role of art in our society. Through trans-disciplinary thinking and experimental
methodologies, students utilize a range of artistic disciplines in a state-of-the-art facility. Equal emphasis is placed
on both individual and collective exploration, where students are encouraged to develop relationships across the
university and broader communities.
 
Many students will use the program in art as a foundation for careers in which creativity and visual studies are
especially valued, as the basis for advanced training in professional schools (such as art, architecture, museum
studies), and for employment in galleries, museums, commercial art, or design-related fields. An important goal of
the department is to help students become readers of the rich visual environment in our culture throughout their
lives, as well as to encourage creative approaches to learning in all disciplines.
 
The Department of Art offers several opportunities for extracurricular activities in the arts including a student-run art
gallery, and Space 204 arts laboratory which hosts exhibitions and workshops throughout the year. Studio VU
lecture series brings some of the most important artists working today to campus for lectures and one-on-one studio
visits with students.
 
Since 1984 the Department of Art has supervised the Margaret Stonewall Wooldridge Hamblet Award given to an
eligible senior art major. This prestigious award provides the means for travel and independent art activity for one
year, culminating in a one-person exhibition at Vanderbilt. Our immersive program includes both junior and senior
major trips to New York and other important art destinations.
 
Many other prizes are awarded in our department. The Allan P. Deloach Memorial Prize in Photography was
established in 2000 in memory of Allan Deloach (B.A. 1963) by two of his colleagues at IBM. This cash award is open
to any student who has taken a studio class in any discipline at Vanderbilt. Midsouth Ceramics awards are given to
the top three ceramic projects in the annual open house, and the Plaza Artists Materials awards are given to four
students each year. All competitions are judged by outside professional artists.
 
Program of Concentration in Art
The art major requires 30 credit hours and presents students the opportunity to explore their ideas conceptually, as
well as to learn the technical skills involved in the creation of art. The program offers a wide range of classes and
media. Our students are offered a strong grounding in traditional processes such as drawing, painting, ceramics,
and sculpture, as well as the opportunity to explore contemporary processes involving video, performance, digital
photographic, and new media, installation, and social interactive art practice. Our diverse faculty utilizes a wide
range of teaching styles and aesthetic philosophies. We consider how ideas have been developed through the
centuries as well as how specific techniques have been used to enrich the expression of an idea. In addition to
modern art history offerings, art majors are encouraged to take courses in pre-Renaissance, non-Western art
history, philosophy of aesthetics, and film. The Contemporary Art Maymester offers an opportunity to study
Page 296 of 1019 

contemporary art in a concentrated manner.

The Department of Asian Studies provides students with a foundation in the languages, cultures, and societies of
Asia and the Asian diaspora necessary to pursue a career among a wide host of global companies, institutions, and
agencies that do business in the United States and abroad with the many countries of Asia. Rich in diverse histories
and cultures, present-day Asia and the Asian diaspora are at the center of the global future. A degree in Asian
Studies equips its students with the linguistic competence and cultural knowledge to join in that global future,
whether it be as a foreign press correspondent, investment banker, video game designer, translator/interpreter,
educator, diplomat, tour operator, ad firm consultant, or traditional Chinese medicine practitioner. With the study of
modern Asian languages at its core, the program embraces a wide variety of courses in the art, culture, economics,
history, film and media, politics, religion, medicine, and sociology of East Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia, Asian
America, and Asian diasporic communities throughout the world. Through their teaching and research, faculty
members promote a better understanding of multiple facets of life in Asia and the region’s past and present
relationship with the rest of the world.
 
Majors and minors are strongly encouraged to complete a study abroad program in Asia. Up to 6 credit hours of
Asia-related courses from Vanderbilt-approved study abroad programs may be applied toward the major or minor

The study of chemical processes within living systems is an interdisciplinary enterprise that spans the fields of
Page 308 of 1019 

chemistry, molecular and cellular biology, biophysics, and engineering. Chemical biology and biochemistry use
chemical insight, techniques, and tools to study or manipulate biological systems. They are the cornerstones of
medical technology and therapeutics. To provide students with training in modern principles at a chemistry-biology
interface, Vanderbilt’s interdisciplinary major in biochemistry and chemical biology incorporates expertise from
multiple departments in the university. Students receive a broad background in the natural sciences (chemistry,
biology, physics) and mathematics, followed by fundamental core training in principles of biochemistry and chemical
biology that involves both theoretical and laboratory course work. Students then pursue an area of emphasis in
either biochemistry or chemical biology through upper-level elective courses. Students participate in independent
research in laboratories of biochemistry and chemical biology faculty. Additional research experience is available in
the Honors Program.
 
Program of Concentration
The biochemistry and chemical biology major tracks share fundamental core elements but have a distinct set of
foundational courses, track-specific electives, and laboratory requirements. All students are required to complete a
set of basic science and mathematics courses. The major consists of 32 credit hours beyond these basic science and
mathematics courses. All students complete 12 credit hours of core courses, 14 credit hours of either biochemistry
or chemical biology track, and 6 credit hours of general electives. For suggested paths of completion, see the
Program in Biochemistry and Chemical Biology website.

Honors Program
Students in either Biochemistry or Chemical Biology track may apply to the Honors Program if they hold a minimum
cumulative GPA of 3.3 and a GPA of at least 3.4 in courses that count toward the major at the end of their junior
year. The purpose of the Honors Program is to provide students with an intensive independent research experience
in a host laboratory. Honors candidates must complete two semesters (3 credit hours each semester) of Honors
Research (BCB 4999). The successful completion of one semester of BCB 4999 may substitute for the BCB 4965
course requirement. Upon entering the program at the end of the junior year, candidates assemble a committee of
the major research adviser and two additional faculty members appropriate to the area of research. As part of the
research course work, the candidate will write an honors thesis. At the end of the graduating semester, honors
candidates must submit a written thesis and give an oral defense of their research.

COURSES OFFERED: BSCI
 
The biological sciences encompass the study of living organisms and life processes at all levels: ecosystems,
populations, individual organisms, tissues, cells, subcellular structures, and molecules. The Department of Biological
Sciences offers courses that address all of these levels and programs of study for undergraduates and for graduate
students seeking the Ph.D.
 
For undergraduates, the department offers three majors and a minor. All three majors have honors tracks. The
Biological Sciences (BioSci) major is designed for the student seeking a broad base in the biological sciences; it is a
highly flexible program that allows a certain amount of specialization in upper-level courses. The Molecular and
Cellular Biology (MCB) major is designed for students with an interest in developing an in-depth understanding of
how living systems function at the molecular and cellular levels, with upper-level course options ranging in content
from biophysics and biochemistry to developmental biology, and to molecular aspects of evolution. The Ecology,
Evolution, and Organismal Biology (EEOB) major is designed for students with an interest in the areas of biology that
span genomics, ecology, evolutionary biology, comparative genomics, organismal biology, and conservation biology.
The department also offers a minor in biological sciences for students majoring in other disciplines. Interested
students should consult the director of undergraduate studies.
 
The department offers undergraduates opportunities for engaging in faculty-led research projects for course credit.
Students may receive an introduction to the workings of a scientific laboratory through an internship, or a more
intensive, hands-on experience in directed or independent laboratory research. Students on the honors track of any
of the three majors carry out a major honors research project and write an honors thesis. More information about
the majors and minor offered by the department, the honors track of each major, and research opportunities open
to undergraduates is available at our website: as.vanderbilt.edu/biosci.
 
Students may declare only one of the majors offered by the Department of Biological Sciences; double or triple
majors within the department are not permitted. It is strongly recommended that all students take one year of
calculus or calculus/statistics, and one year of physics. Students are encouraged to work with their major advisers to
choose upper-level courses appropriate to their chosen majors.
 
General Requirements
All students in programs of concentration offered by the Department of Biological Sciences must take two
semesters of general chemistry and lab (Chemistry 1601–1602 and 1601L–1602L) and two semesters of
organic chemistry (Chemistry 2211/2221–2212/2222) and lab (2221L–2222L).
A total of 30 credit hours of Biological Sciences courses, including the 8 credit hours of 1510–1511 and 1510L
and either 1511L or 1512L, is required in all majors.
Courses numbered below 1500 do not count toward the major or minor.
Below is a listing of the required courses for the Biological Sciences (BioSci) major, for the Molecular and
Page 311 of 1019 

Cellular Biology (MCB) major, and for the Ecology, Evolution, and Organismal Biology (EEOB) major. Students
with specialized interests within either of the specialized majors may substitute one of the intermediate
courses with an upper- level course with the permission of the director of undergraduate studies and the
Biological Sciences Curriculum Committee (Intermediate Biological Sciences courses: 2101, 2201, 2201L,
2205, 2210, 2210L, 2218, 2219, 2238, 2238L, 2520).
All majors must complete at least 2 credit hours of 3965, 3850, or 3861, though only one semester of 3965
may count toward the 30 credit hours.
A total of no more than 7 credit hours of 3850, 3861, or 3961 may count toward the major.
If option 1 (see below) is used to meet the laboratory requirement, then BSCI 3965 or 2 credit hours of 3850 is
required.
Either BSCI 3229 or BSCI 3270, but not both, may count toward the major or minor.
For Honors, additional requirements must be met. For entry into Honors, students must satisfy the conditions
required by the College of Arts and Science for admission to departmental honors programs. Students must have an
overall grade point average equal to or greater than 3.3, and a grade point average in courses required for the
appropriate biological sciences major equal to or greater than 3.4 at the time of entry. Applications must be
approved by a majority vote of the faculty of the department. To receive honors or highest honors in biological
sciences, a student in the departmental Honors Program must:
Complete the requirements for either the MCB, BioSci, or EEOB major, achieving a minimum cumulative
grade point average of 3.4 in all courses that count toward the major;
Satisfactorily pursue a research project under the supervision of the adviser with a minimum of 10 credit
hours of Honors Research, BSCI 4999;
Give a progress report to the Honors Committee at the end of the first semester of This will consist of a short,

The foundations of biomedical engineering are the same as those in other engineering disciplines: mathematics,
physics, chemistry, and engineering principles. Biomedical engineering builds on these foundations to solve
problems in biology  and medicine over the widest range of scales-from the nanoscale and molecular levels to the
whole body. Biomedical engineering provides a robust platform for employment in the medical device and
instrumentation industries as well as careers in companies that specialize in the development and application of
biologics, biomaterials, computation, implants and processes. Our graduates gain entry into nationally recognized
graduate schools for continuing studies in biomedical engineering.
 
Biomedical engineering is also a rigorous path for admission to and success in medical school for those students
willing and able to excel in mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, physiology, and engineering.
 
The Department of Biomedical Engineering at Vanderbilt is unique among biomedical engineering programs in its
immediate proximity to the world class Vanderbilt Medical Center, located on our compact campus. Our School of
Medicine is among the top ten in funding from the National Institutes of Health and includes a National Cancer
Institute- recognized Comprehensive Cancer Center, a major children’s hospital and a Level I trauma center. This
proximity and the strong relationships among faculty across multiple schools stimulate high impact research and
provide unique educational and research opportunities for students.
 
Degree Programs. The Department of Biomedical Engineering offers courses of study leading to the B.E., M.S.,
M.Eng., and Ph.D. Vanderbilt biomedical engineering is a well-established program with undergraduate degrees
granted continuously since 1965. Our undergraduate curriculum undergoes regular review and revision to ensure
relevancy and to maintain full ABET accreditation. Students have complete flexibility in the selection of biomedical
engineering, technical, and open electives. This allows students to design their own focus areas such as
regenerative medicine and tissue engineering, wearables and point-of-care diagnostics, global health, surgery and
engineering, robotics and prosthetics, lasers and medicine, medical imaging, biotechnology and nanomedicine,
medical technology and entrepreneurship.
 
Facilities. The Department of Biomedical Engineering is located in Stevenson Center. Undergraduate instructional
laboratories are equipped for study of biomedical processes, measurement methods and instrumentation. These
facilities are equipped with embedded systems for instrumentation, design, and testing that mirror professional
practice. Specialized facilities for biomedical imaging, biophotonics, cell and tissue culture, microfabrication, surgery
and intervention, and nanoengineering are used both for faculty-led research and instructional purposes.
 
Undergraduate Honors Program. With approval of the Honors Program director, junior and senior students in
biomedical engineering who have achieved a minimum grade point average of 3.5 may be accepted into the
undergraduate Honors Program. Students in the program take at least 6 credit hours of 5000-level or above
(graduate) biomedical engineering courses, which can be counted toward the 127-hour undergraduate degree
requirements as biomedical engineering electives or which can be taken for graduate school credit. Students in the
Page 315 of 1019 

Honors Program must also complete a two-semester-long research project and present a research report; this is
generally accomplished through the BME 3860 and 3861 Undergraduate Research elective courses. Honors students
must make a grade point average of 3.0 in these classes and maintain an overall 3.5 GPA to be designated as an
honors graduate. The diploma designation is Honors in Biomedical Engineering.

COURSES OFFERED: CHBE
 
Chemical engineers play key roles in the development and production of commodity chemicals, pharmaceuticals,
and bioengineered materials, high strength composites and specialty polymers, semiconductors and microelectronic
devices, and a wide range of ultrapure fine chemicals. Indeed, chemical engineering is essential for the operation of
contemporary society. The solutions to many of the problems that we face today—e.g., energy, the environment,
development of high-performance materials—will involve chemical engineers.
 
The undergraduate program in chemical engineering prepares students to contribute to the solution of these and
similar problems. Graduates find meaningful careers in industry, in government laboratories, and as consultants.
Some continue their education through graduate studies in chemical engineering, business, law, or medicine.
 
Mission. The mission of the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering is to educate those who will
advance the knowledge base in chemical engineering, become practicing chemical engineers, and be leaders in the
chemical and process industries, academia, and government; to conduct both basic and applied research in
chemical engineering and related interdisciplinary areas; and to provide service to the chemical engineering
profession, the School of Engineering, Vanderbilt University, the country, and the world.
 
Degree Programs. The Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering offers the B.E. in chemical
engineering and graduate study leading to the M.Eng., M.S., and Ph.D.
 
Undergraduate chemical engineering students acquire a solid background in mathematics, chemistry, biology,
physics, and computing. The chemical and biomolecular engineering program has as its basis courses in transport
phenomena, thermodynamics, separations, and kinetics. Other courses deal with the principles and techniques of
chemical engineering analysis and design, along with economic analysis, process control, chemical process safety,
bioprocessing, process simulation, and engineering ethics. Laboratory courses offer the student an opportunity to
make fundamental measurements of momentum, heat, and mass transport and to gain hands-on experience with
bench scale and small scale pilot-plant equipment, which can be computer controlled. Effective report writing and
technical communication are principal skills gained in the laboratory and design courses. Many students carry out
individual research projects.
 
A specimen curriculum for a chemical engineering major follows. This standard program includes electives that
students, in consultation with their faculty advisers, select to pursue breadth or a minor or focus area with their
chemical engineering major. Specimen curricula with emphases in specific areas are available on the department
website. Double majors may be arranged in consultation with a faculty adviser.
 
Students are recommended to take the Fundamentals of Engineering Examination (FE) in their senior year. This is
the first step in obtaining a license as a professional engineer. The following courses are recommended for
preparation for the FE: ECE 2112, CE 2200, and ME 2190.
 
Undergraduate Honors Program. The Honors Program in chemical engineering provides an opportunity for selected
Page 319 of 1019 

students to develop individually through independent study and research. General requirements are described in
the Special Programs chapter. The chemical and biomolecular engineering department requires a minimum overall
GPA of 3.5. Acceptance to the program is made by petition to the faculty during the junior year. Transfer students
may be considered for admission after completing one semester at Vanderbilt. Candidates for honors choose their
technical courses with the consent of a faculty honors adviser. Requirements include at least 6 hours of CHBE
courses numbered 5000 or above, plus 6 hours of CHBE 3860 and 3861 taken in the junior and/or senior year under
the direction of a faculty honors adviser. A formal written research report is submitted each semester CHBE 3860 or
3861 is taken with a final report and presentation given in the spring semester of the senior year to the CHBE
faculty and students. The diploma designation is Honors in Chemical Engineering.
 
Facilities. The Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering department is located in Olin Hall. Undergraduate
instructional laboratories are equipped for study of transport phenomena, unit operations, kinetics, and process
control. Current research areas for which facilities are available include molecular modeling; colloid and surface
science; biochemical engineering and biotechnology; materials processing and characterization; energy and the
environment.

COURSES OFFERED: CHEM
 
The Department of Chemistry seeks to provide a sound education in the fundamentals of modern chemistry as well
as exposure to cutting-edge research and contemporary instrumentation in the field. This is accomplished by
providing students with a solid background in the disciplines of organic, analytical, inorganic, biological, and physical
chemistry. The core courses in these areas, which are supported by a variety of practical experimental experiences
in the laboratory, provide students with the skills needed to think critically about chemistry. After these core
courses, students delve deeper into an area of their choice. Recognizing the importance of research, which
integrates and makes sense of our collective body of knowledge, we encourage students to participate in
undergraduate research. The chemistry major at Vanderbilt University meets the guidelines for the American
Chemical Society approved program of study in chemistry.
 
Program of Concentration in Chemistry
The chemistry program is organized into four parts. The first part is a general chemistry course sequence (CHEM
1601–1602 and 1601L–1602L or AP credit) to serve as an entry point into the major. The second part consists of
foundation courses in the five major disciplines of chemistry: analytical (2100), biochemistry (BSCI 2520), inorganic
(3010), organic (2221–2222 or 2211–2212), and physical (3300 or 3310). The third part of the chemistry major
consists of completing 8 credit hours of laboratory past 1601L–1602L. Four credit hours are from laboratory courses
(2221L–2222L, 2100L, and 3315) associated with foundation courses. There are also 6 credit hours of a capstone
laboratory (4965–4966) designed to provide advanced laboratory experience. The fourth part of the major consists
of completing a minimum of 6 credit hours of in-depth chemistry courses. These in-depth courses build upon the
content of foundation courses or integrate concepts from these foundational disciplines.

COURSES OFFERED: CE
 
Vanderbilt's Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering offers a broad-based education in civil and
environmental engineering fundamentals, coupled with development of leadership, management, and
communications skills to establish a foundation for lifelong learning and flexible career development. This goal
requires going beyond technical competence in a balanced education to develop future leaders in the fields of
consulting, industry, business, law, government, and research.
 
B.E. in civil engineering. Civil engineers must be able to face complex problems of modern society involving the
development of physical facilities that serve the public while protecting the environment and preserving social
values. Challenges facing civil and environmental engineers concern housing, urban transportation, pollution
control, water resources development, industrial development, maintaining and advancing our nation’s aging
Page 326 of 1019 

infrastructure, and exploring space. Addressing these challenges with today’s limited resources requires innovative
and original ideas from highly-skilled engineers.
 
Undergraduates majoring in civil engineering receive a strong background in mathematics, science, engineering
science, and engineering design. The program also includes courses in economics, humanities, social sciences,
resources management, and public policy. Students participate in design teams and laboratory studies as well as
classroom activities. Use of various computer-based methods is integral to problem solving and design.
 
Vanderbilt’s B.E. in civil engineering prepares students for entry-level positions in many specialty areas of civil
engineering, as well as many other types of careers, such as business, construction, and law. Today, however, and
even more so in the future, professional practice at a high level will require an advanced degree. We recommend
that students seriously consider pursuing the M.S. or M. Eng. soon after obtaining the B.E.
 
B.E./M.Eng. Five Year Program. Students seeking advanced study in civil and environmental engineering may be
interested in the combined B.E./M.Eng., enabling students to complete the B.E. in civil engineering and M.Eng. in
civil engineering or environmental engineering in five years.
 
Construction Management Five Year Program. Students seeking advanced study in construction management may
be interested in the combined B.E./M.Eng., enabling students to complete the B.E. in civil engineering and M.Eng. in
civil engineering (construction management emphasis) in five years.
 
Undergraduate Honors Program. Recognized with the diploma designation Honors in Civil Engineering, exceptional
students may be invited in their junior year to participate in the civil engineering Honors Program. Designed as a
unique individualized educational experience, participants work closely with departmental faculty members to tailor
a selection of courses that actively immerses them in a selected field of study. Experiences include enrollment in a 3
semester hour independent study course and participation in a summer research internship. Honors Program
participants are especially well-prepared to enter graduate study, and they may count the independent study course
towards their civil engineering technical electives.
 
Facilities. The civil engineering laboratory provides for static and dynamic testing of materials and structural
components and assemblies. Testing facilities include capabilities of testing composites, metals, and concrete under
static loads, fatigue, base acceleration (to simulate seismic events) and intermediate to high speed impacts (to
simulate responses to blast events). Full soils testing facilities are available. Hydraulics facilities include several
model flow systems to illustrate principles of fluid mechanics and hydrology. The transportation laboratory is
computer-based, with emphasis on transportation systems and design, intelligent transportation systems, and
geographic information systems. The environmental laboratories are fully supplied with modern instrumentation for
chemical, physical, biological, and radiological analysis of soils, sediments, water, wastewater, air, and solid waste.
They include equipment for the study of biological waste treatment, physical-chemical waste treatment,
containment mass transfer, and state-of-the-art instrumentation. All are available for student use in courses,
demonstrations, and research.

The Department of Classical and Mediterranean Studies offers students an interdisciplinary perspective on the
culture and history of a region at the crossroads of human civilization since antiquity. The study of the
Mediterranean world examines the influential achievements and legacy of the Greeks and Romans alongside the
emergence and spread of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam to the East. It also explores the premodern to modern
development of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia, which have variously responded to the ancient and
medieval past. The program offers courses in the history, religion, philosophy, art, literature, society, and culture of
the Mediterranean world. In teaching and research, the faculty promote the integrated study of past and present
through both written and material sources—textual, artifactual, visual, spatial—and they embrace analytical

techniques in the digital humanities. Students thus have the opportunity to learn several ancient and medieval
languages of Europe and the Middle East and to pursue experiential learning overseas, from intensive modern
language study to archaeological fieldwork to the investigation of evolving cultural and natural landscapes.
 
Majors in classical and Mediterranean studies are introduced to the distinctive geography and history of the region
but choose their courses in one of three tracks. These tracks have shared content but offer different viewpoints and
training. Majors who expect to apply for graduate study should work closely with an adviser to devise an
appropriate curriculum.
 
Students who pursue Classical and Near Eastern Languages and Cultures investigate one or more ancient to
medieval cultural tradition(s) in the Greco-Roman and Near Eastern spheres through the study of original texts and
their historical setting, such as Greek tragedy, Latin oratory, Hebrew scripture, the Qur’an, or early French romance.
 
Students who pursue Mediterranean Archaeology explore human diversity and experience from Classical Antiquity
to the Middle Ages through the study of material and visual culture. They too learn to read textual sources while
acquiring the skills of archaeological and art-historical research.
Students who pursue Mediterranean Studies, the most flexible track for a broad range of interests, can choose to
engage with a variety of ancient, medieval, or modern topics through focused or comparative study.
 
The Department of Classical and Mediterranean Studies also offers a minor in Mediterranean Archaeology and a
minor in Mediterranean Studies. A student cannot earn more than one minor in the program.
 
The Honors Program requires the production of a thesis representing advanced, original, and substantial research.
 
Students are strongly recommended to pursue study abroad in the Mediterranean or an adjacent region. The
department has long supported the Intercollegiate Center for Classical Studies, the American Academy in Rome, and
the American School of Classical Studies in Athens. Many different international experiences are possible through
Vanderbilt-approved semester programs, Maymesters, research projects, and summer study, for example, in Italy,
Greece, and Israel. Students are encouraged to participate in local and regional conferences, where they can share
the results of collaborative or independent work. Those concentrating on Greek and/or Latin language who qualify
academically are invited to join Eta Sigma Phi, the national classics honor society.
 
Program of Concentration in Classical and Mediterranean Studies
Students majoring in Classical and Mediterranean Studies must take ten courses, including one foundation course
(CLAS 1010). The major is arranged into three tracks and an honors track. Students must formally declare a track 1–
3 at the time the major is declared. A score of 4 or 5 on the AP Latin exam earns 3 hours of credit for Latin 2202,
which may be applied toward any of the major tracks. Any course for which a student has earned credit will count
for one and only one of the requirements or sub-requirements for any of the major tracks or minors.
 
Track 1: Classical and Near Eastern Languages and Cultures
30–34 total credit hours including:
1. One foundation course: CLAS 1010 (3 credit hours);
2. Language/Literature: Five courses from Course List A (15 credit hours, or 19 credit hours if including ARA
1101– 1102);
3. Culture: Four courses from Course Lists B–D numbered 2060 or above (12 credit hours).
Latin courses at the 1000 level do not count toward this major track. Students who fulfill their language/literature

DIRECTOR OF UNDERGRADUATE STUDIES Zdravka Tzankova (Climate and Environmental Studies)
 
COURSES OFFERED: ENVS
 
Human beings and their societies necessarily interact with and alter the Earth’s natural environment. Climate and
Environmental Studies (CES) is home to two interdisciplinary undergraduate programs. Both the Climate Studies
major (CLIM) and the Environmental and Sustainability Studies (ESS) minor allow the student to examine human
interaction with the environment by concentrating on methods in the natural sciences, humanities and social
sciences with some experience in the other areas of study as well as environmental engineering and social
engagement. The major, in particular, is designed to provide students with a strong foundation in the full range of
disciplinary perspectives across the humanities, natural sciences and social sciences.
 
Program of Concentration (I) in Climate Studies
 
The major requires 30 credit hours. Some of the courses require prerequisites, and students are responsible for
meeting those prerequisites if they choose to satisfy the major with those classes.

Program II: Honors Program in Climate Studies
 
The Honors Track offers majors in Climate Studies the opportunity to pursue intensive work through an independent
research project. Students interested in pursuing the Honors Track should contact the director of undergraduate
studies for more information. To be considered for the Honors Track in Climate Studies, a student must have a
minimum cumulative GPA of 3.4 and a minimum GPA of 3.6 for courses that count toward the major. Students
should express interest to the director of undergraduate studies before March 1 of their junior year. Students who
are recommended for the program by the director of undergraduate studies will typically begin the program by
taking ENVS 4101W during the fall term of the senior year.  
Page 338 of 1019 

 
The Honors Track requires the following:
 
1. Successful completion of requirements 1-7 in Program I, for a total of 30 credit hours. Requirements 1, 2, and 6
must be completed prior to beginning the honors courses.  
 
2. Successful completion of at least two semesters of honors coursework (6 credit hours) for the Honors Track.
Students take ENVS 4101W or ENVS 4981 (Honors Research) during the first semester of their senior year, when
they develop the literature review and research plan. The first semester of honors coursework counts as part of
requirement 7 of Program I and can be used to fulfill the requirements for Program I should students not go on to
finish honors during the second semester of honors coursework.  After completing the first semester of honors
coursework, students then take a minimum of 3 and maximum of 6 credit hours of 4981 (Honors Research) during
the second semester, which is in addition to the 30 credits required to complete the standard major. Thus students
must take a minimum of 6 credit hours of honors coursework and may take up to 9 credit hours.
 
3. In order to earn honors in Climate Studies, students must successfully complete, defend, and perform requested
revisions on the honors thesis before deadlines for graduation. Successful defense of the completed thesis is through
an oral presentation and examination by the thesis adviser and a designated faculty reader near the end of the
student's final semester. Revisions must be completed and the thesis submitted no later than the last day of
undergraduate classes.
 
4. Students meeting these requirements receive honors or highest honors in Climate Studies, depending on the
quality of the thesis and performance on the defense.  Successful candidates will be recognized in the
commencement program and receive a Vanderbilt diploma that records honors or highest honors in Climate Studies.
 
Comprehensive Exam
In order to graduate with a climate studies major, students must take a comprehensive exam during their senior
year. The exam is not graded, and no grade will appear on the student's transcript. The purpose of the exam is to
test the extent to which climate studies majors are retaining core aspects of the climate & environmental studies
curriculum.
 
Minor in Environmental and Sustainability Studies
 
Students who want to minor in environmental and sustainability studies must take a minimum of six courses (18
credit hours total) chosen from the courses listed below; additional relevant courses may be counted with approval
of the director of the program. Courses must be distributed as follows: (A) one Natural Science- and Technology-
Intensive course; (B) one Humanities course; (C) one Social-Behavioral Sciences and Policy-Intensive course; (D) two
additional courses from B and/or C; and (E) a capstone course. No more than two courses may be at the 1000 level.
In addition,  no more than 3 credit hours may be counted simultaneously toward both the environmental and
sustainability studies minor and any other major or minor. Topics courses may count toward the minor with approval
of the director.

Whatever the undertaking, the comprehensive academic training in this program enables engineers to evaluate the
impact of their decisions, whether working with hardware, software, or the interface between the two.
 
The computer engineering program combines fundamental core requirements with flexibility to allow students to
specialize in a variety of emphasis areas within the program. The curriculum includes requirements in the basic
sciences, mathematics, and humanities; a primary core of hardware and software courses; and a set of electives
that combine breadth and depth requirements as described below. Students who major in computer engineering
who wish to apply for graduate study in electrical engineering or computer science are encouraged strongly to
select their elective courses to demonstrate depth in that particular area; the structure of the program enables that
option. The course of study leads to a bachelor of engineering.
 
Undergraduate Honors Program. With faculty approval, junior and senior students may be accepted into the Honors
Program. To achieve honors status, the student must:
1. achieve and maintain a minimum GPA of 3.5.
2. complete 3 hours of undergraduate research (ECE 3860, 3861 or CS 3860, 3861) with final written report
3. complete 6 hours of ECE program elective credit from the following list:
a. up to 3 additional hours of undergraduate research (ECE 3860, 3861 or CS 3860, 3861), or
b. design domain expertise (DE) courses beyond the one course required by the program, or
c. CS 3259, CS 3892, CS 4287, or
d. 5000-level courses.
The diploma designation is Honors in Computer Engineering.
 
Facilities. Electrical and computer engineering supports undergraduate laboratories emphasizing the principal areas
of the disciplines: analog and digital electronics, microcomputers, microprocessors, microelectronics, and
instrumentation. In addition, several specialized facilities are available for graduate research: the advanced carbon
nanotechnology and diamond labs, the Institute for Software Integrated Systems, the Institute for Space and
Defense Electronics, the Medical Image Processing Laboratory, the Center for Intelligent Systems and Robotics
Laboratories, the Embedded Computer Systems Laboratory, and biomedical, biosensing, and photonics laboratories.
 
The work in electrical and computer engineering is supported by a variety of computers and networks, including the
high-performance computing facilities of the Advanced Computing Center for Research and Education. Vanderbilt is
one of the founding partners in the Internet II initiative.
 
Students interested in the major or minor in Computer Engineering are encouraged to consider instead
those in Electrical and Computer Engineering.
 
The major or minor in Computer Engineering may no longer be declared. CmPE students will be
supported in completing the relevant program, including the pursuit of honors in the major if relevant.

COURSES OFFERED: CSET
 
The Program in Communication of Science and Technology (CSET) sits at the intersection of the sciences and the
humanities, and it builds on the vast amount of effort at Vanderbilt devoted to interdisciplinary work that spans the
natural sciences, engineering, the social sciences, and the humanities. CSET draws on both the scientific
communities (natural sciences, social sciences, engineering, medicine) and the creative communities (public
speaking, writing, digital media production) across multiple colleges at Vanderbilt.
 
CSET is designed for students who have an interest in science and technology and also are interested in
communicating science and technology to both peer-professional audiences and to the larger world. CSET is ideal as
a second major for students pursuing a first major in one of the natural sciences, any of several of the social
sciences, engineering, the Science, Medicine and Technology concentration in History, and the Creative Writing track
in English. In the twenty-first century scientists must be able to communicate their work and their ideas to their
professional peers, to nonspecialists who review grant proposals, and to lay audiences who ultimately fund,
support, and benefit from the discoveries made in laboratories around the world. In return, the scientific community
needs support from professional writers, journalists, technical writing specialists, public speakers, film and video
writers and producers, and bloggers in communicating modern science, technology, and medicine to lay audiences.

Program of Concentration in Communication Studies
Communication studies explores purposive human communication. The Department of Communication Studies is
particularly devoted to an understanding of public discourse in the broadest sense, with an emphasis on the role of
persuasion in civil society. To that end the subjects of study range from political discourse to commercial
advertisement, from the history of rhetoric to the impact of mass media, from criticism of public oratory to issues of
freedom of speech. The department offers courses involving practice, criticism, and theoretical analysis.
Education in these areas has traditionally produced citizen advocates who enter public life in business, law,
journalism, and communication.

COURSES OFFERED: EES
 
The Earth and environmental sciences are aimed at understanding Earth’s governing processes—how they operate
and interact—as well as interpreting Earth’s dynamic history—its age and origin as recorded in rocks and the
landscape— and finally, at understanding how geological processes affect modern environmental and ecological
systems, including humans. Among the natural sciences, ours is the quintessential interdisciplinary science,
providing vital perspective on how Earth’s physical and geochemical template simultaneously sustains and
threatens life, and influences human interactions with Earth.
 
The Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences (EES) offers an integrated Earth and Environmental Sciences
undergraduate major leading to the B.A. degree. Students majoring in EES take a core set of science courses with
lab, computational, and field components, design an academic plan that allows them to develop expertise in an
area of interest within EES. The comparatively small size of the faculty and student body allows many opportunities
for faculty-student interaction. Students use the major as preparation for graduate study, for careers in
environmental and climate science, geology, and natural resource and energy management, and for related fields
such as land use planning, teaching, conservation, business, law, or engineering.
 
Research programs in the department, which in many cases involve students, employ field, analytical, and
experimental methods. A wide variety of Earth processes are investigated, ranging from the migration of fluids and
generation of magmas in the Earth’s crust, to the movement of mass and energy across land, ocean, and
atmosphere, to the evolution of life and ecosystems, to the impacts of humans on the environment. Study areas, in
addition to Tennessee, include the southwestern United States, the Pacific northwest, Florida, Colorado, Antarctica,
South Asia, Brazil, Italy, Greenland, Peru, Namibia, the Bahamas, Australia, and New Zealand.
 
Program of Concentration in Earth and Environmental Sciences
The Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences offers two tracks to an EES major, to support the preparation
of future scientists and students aimed at science-related pursuits. Both tracks provide a solid grounding in the
integrated Earth and environmental sciences while allowing flexibility in the particular focus and support
communication, quantitative, and computational skills.
Track 1
This track is designed for students who aim to build a strong, integrated earth and environmental science foundation
to inform discussions and work in policy, education, law, advocacy, community engagement, conservation, finance,
etc. but do not aim to work as practicing scientists. This pathway pairs well with programs in Climate and
Environmental Studies, Environmental Sociology, Communication of Science and Technology, Secondary Education,
and other non-STEM majors that, together, will prepare students for the interdisciplinary nature of addressing the
Earth and environmental challenges of our future.
 
Track 1 of the EES major is organized into six parts, beginning with two of three introductory courses that serve as
entry points. The second part involves a core course that provides all EES majors with a common background in
ways of thinking in Earth and environmental sciences. This core course must be completed before students may
enroll in  more advanced EES courses. As Earth and Environmental sciences employ techniques and foundational
knowledge from all other STEM fields, part 3 of the major builds skills in supporting STEM fields through three
classes: one in scientific computing, one in statistics, and one additional supporting science elective.
 
Page 359 of 1019 

The fourth part of the major defines a focus for the student through both experiential and seminar-style EES courses.
The fifth component addresses science communication skills with one course.  The sixth component of the major is a
1 credit hour seminar that serves as a capstone for senior students. In addition to the major, qualified Track 1
students may elect to participate in the Honors Program designed for highly motivated students who want to pursue
research as undergraduates. Opportunities for research may be available to other students outside of the Honors
Program.
 
At least 36 credit hours toward the major are required as follows:
 
1. EES Foundations (3+1 credit hours each): Two introductory courses, one with lab, from
1510/1510L, 1030/1030L, and/or 1081/1081L
7
2. EES Core (4 credit hours): 2510, 
Required as prerequisite for nearly all upper level EES courses
4
3. STEM Foundation (3 credit hours each): 
One course in scientific computing: CS 1101 or DS 1101
One course in statistics: MATH 1011, DS 2100, BSCI 3270, ECON 1500 or 1510, MATH 218,
2820, or 2821, SOC 2100
One additional supporting science: any additional course from ASTR, BSCI, CHEM, MATH,
PHYS, CS, DS excluding courses numbered 1111 and excluding BSCI 1400. Other courses from
the School of Engineering may be considered with permission of the DUS
9
4. EES Focus (1-4 credit hours each):
At least five classes and at least 15 hours, chosen from any EES course numbered 2050 or
above 3000. Must include at least two courses at the 4000 level. At least eight hours in this
category must be experiential, from the following: lab courses (EES 3220, 3260, 3280, 3310,
3330, 3340), field-based courses (EES 3865 [3-4 credit hours or 1 credit hour attached to
another regular EES course with permission]), EES 3875, or an include up to three credit hours
of research or internships (EES 3841, 3842, 3881, 4998, 4999)
15-17
5. Earth Science Communication (0-3 credit hours): Any CSET course, any writing-intensive
(W) course from EES, BSCI, CHEM, PHYS, or one course from the following: EES 3875, 4233,
4680, 4996+4997, SCED 2330
0-3
6. Senior Seminar: 4961
1
 
 
Total hours:
36-41
Track 2
This track is designed to prepare students for careers as earth and environmental scientists, including entering the
science workforce after graduation and/or pursuing postgraduate academic work.
 
Given the broad and interdisciplinary nature of EES, it is important that students design an academic plan in
consultation with their adviser and referencing the EES Disciplinary Pathway documents, to ensure appropriate
preparation for their area of interest. Preparing to be competitive for graduate programs may include additional
coursework beyond the major requirements, particularly advanced math, computing, chemistry, biosciences, or
physics, depending on disciplinary interest. Students on this pathway are encouraged to pursue research
particularly if aimed at post-graduate academic work.
 
Note that prerequisite STEM courses (CHEM 1601, PHYS 1501/1601, MATH 1100/1201/1301) may be taken on an
ungraded basis for students above the freshman level, but working knowledge of the course content will be required
Page 360 of 1019 

in upper-level EES and other STEM courses.
 
Students who are interested in pursuing minor and/or double majors in other STEM fields should discuss options
with the DUS as some coursework in other departments may replace EES coursework if part of an intentionally
designed plan made in consultation with the adviser and DUS.
 
Track 2 is organized into six parts, beginning with one of three introductory courses that serve as an entry point. The
second part involves three core courses that provide all Track 2 majors with a common background in methods and
ways of thinking in Earth and environmental sciences. At least one EES core course must be completed before
students may enroll in more advanced focus courses of part four. Specific core courses may be prerequisite for
related upper-level electives, and so students are encouraged to take these early in their academic career. As Earth
and Environmental sciences employ techniques and foundational knowledge from all other STEM fields, courses in
part 2 and part 4 of the major have outside STEM courses as prerequisites and part 3 of the major rquires students to
build additional skills in supporting STEM fields through two more STEM electives: one of which must be quantitative
or computational.
 
The fourth part of the major defines a focus for the student through both experiential and seminar-style EES courses.
The fifth component addresses science communication skills with one course.  The sixth component of the major is a
1 credit hour seminar that serves as a capstone for senior students. Track 2 students are strongly encouraged to
pursue research. Highly motivated and successful students may elect to participate in the EES Honors Program.
 
At least 37 credit hours toward the major are required as follows:
 
1. EES Foundations (3+1 credit hours each): One introductory course with lab, from
1510/1510L, 1030/1030L, and/or 1081/1081L
4
2. EES Core (4 credit hours): 2510, 2550, and one course in physical dynamics from the
following list: EES 2580, 4420, 4550, 4650. Note that all EES physical-dynamic focused
courses have MATH 110/1201/1301 and PHYS 1501/1601/1911 as prerequisite and that CHEM
1601 is corequisite for EES 2550.
Required as prerequisite for nearly all upper level EES courses
11
3. STEM Electives (3 credit hours each): 
Two courses from the following: CHEM 1602 or higher; PHYS 1502/1602, 1912 or higher, MATH

Designing Area of Focus
In-depth Earth and Environmental Sciences courses can be chosen to define a focus area within EES. Students
should consult with their major adviser and follow guidance documents posted on the departmental website to
choose a focus area and associated course options. All parts of the Earth and its environments are interconnected,
and the integrated Earth and Environmental Science major allows students to create a comprehensive
understanding of the cycling of energy and materials through Earth’s four spheres (lithosphere, hydrosphere,
atmosphere, and biosphere) while also developing some more specific expertise through a focus.  
Honors in Earth and Environmental Sciences
The EES Honors Program provides research experience and mentoring in preparation for a career or graduate
studies in Earth and environmental sciences. Interested students should apply to the undergraduate adviser for
entry into the Honors Program fall semester, junior year. A grade point average of 3.3 or higher both cumulatively
and in courses that count toward the EES major is required for admission to the Honors Program.
Working closely with a faculty adviser, students in the Honors Program complete a research project of interest to
both the student and faculty member during the junior and senior years. In order to graduate with honors in EES, a
student must: (1) maintain a 3.3 grade point average both in the EES major and cumulatively; (2) complete the
required courses for the EES major; (3) complete Senior Honors Seminar (4996, 4997) and Senior Honors Research
(4998, 4999); (4) satisfactorily present the results of his/her research in written form as a senior thesis to two
members of the faculty and orally to students and faculty of the department.
 
Minor in Earth and Environmental Sciences
The minor in EES provides students with a broad background in Earth processes, systems, and history, and an
introduction to environmental issues. This background is highly relevant to many different fields of endeavor. The
minor does not fully prepare students for graduate studies or employment as Earth or environmental scientists,
though it could do so paired with another relevant STEM major. Students should consult with the director of
undergraduate studies about how the minor in EES fits with their career or graduate school interests.
 
The minor consists of at least five courses (at least 17 credit hours; EES 1510/1510L, 1030/1030L, and EES
1081/1081L each count as one course). Students are encouraged to choose courses based on their interests and
career plans and to discuss course selection with the director of undergraduate studies. No more than two 1000-
level courses count toward the minor. Two courses with labs are required; one must be numbered above 2000. No
credit toward the minor is given for EES 3841–3842 or 3851–3852.
 
Licensure for Teaching
EES majors may choose a second major in science education which includes teaching licensure, a prudent choice if
interested in teaching. Peabody offers a fifth-year master’s program for science majors interested in teaching. Upon
graduating with a B.A. in EES, EES majors in the fifth-year program would spend the next summer and academic
year earning their M.Ed. and teaching licensure.
 
Students seeking teacher certification in science disciplines at the secondary level should refer to the chapter on
Certification for Teaching in the Peabody College section of the Undergraduate Catalog. Please contact Professor
Heather Johnson, coordinator of science secondary education, at heather.j.johnson@vanderbilt.edu for more
information.

COURSES OFFERED: ECON
 
The Department of Economics offers an undergraduate major and minor in economics. Qualified economics majors
may also elect to take graduate courses or participate in honors work.
 
The department participates with the Department of History in a concentration in economics and history. Other
economics-related minors are discussed under the Undergraduate Business Minor.
 
Economics 1010 and 1020 are prerequisites to all courses numbered above 2000, except Economics 2220 which
only requires Economics 1010.
Program of Concentration in Economics
The requirements for the major include completion of at least 33 credit hours in economics courses, including 1010,
1020, 1500 or 1510 (or Math 2820L with Math 2810 or Math 2820), 3012, 3022, and 3032 or 3035. At least 9 credit
hours must be in courses numbered above 3035. At least 15 credit hours that count toward the economics major
must be taken at Vanderbilt. Undergraduate Business Minor (BUSA) elective courses do not count toward the
economics major.
 
Economics 1111 may be counted as an elective. No more than 3 credit hours of independent study may be included
Page 363 of 1019 

in the minimum 33 credit hours required for the major.
Mathematics Prerequisite
MATH 1201 (or MATH 1301) is a prerequisite for Economics courses numbered 3000 and above.
Minor in Economics
The minor in economics requires 21 credit hours, including 1010, 1020, 1500 or 1510 (or Math 2820L with Math
2810 or Math 2820), 3012, and 9 credit hours of electives. At least one elective must be numbered above 3015.
 
Students who complete either Economics 3032 or 3035 with Math 2820L and Math 2810 or Math 2820 as a
prerequisite need not take Economics 1500 or 1510. Undergraduate Business Minor (BUSA) elective courses do not
count toward the economics minor.
Honors Program
An honors program is available in economics. This program is designed for highly motivated students interested in
doing independent research. Students who meet the College of Arts and Science’s requirements for honors
candidacy as set forth elsewhere in this catalog should consult the director of undergraduate studies no later than
the fall term of their junior year. Honors candidates must complete 36 credit hours in economics, including the 18
credit hours of courses required of all economics majors. Honors candidates should complete 3032 or 3035 before
senior year. In addition, the Honors Program requires completion of (1) Economics 3698 Junior Honors Research (1
credit hour), (2) Economics 3851–3852 Senior Thesis (6 credit hours), culminating in a written thesis, (3) Economics
4981–4982 Honors Seminar (2 credit hours), (4) 9 credit hours of electives including at least 6 credit hours in
Economics courses above 3035. Honors candidates are required to write a senior thesis and to defend it in an oral
examination. On satisfactory completion of this program, a student will graduate with honors or with highest honors
in economics.
Program of Concentration in Economics and History
This is an interdisciplinary program split between Economics and History that provides a more focused program of
study while requiring fewer credit hours than a double major in the two fields. The program consists of 45 credit
hours of course work of which 9 credit hours are from a common economic history core and the remaining 36 credit
hours are evenly divided between Economics and History. Students are expected to observe course-specific
requirements in each department. The details are spelled out below under Economics and History.
Licensure for Teaching
Candidates for teacher licensure in economics at the secondary level should refer to the chapter on Licensure for
Teaching in the Peabody College section of this catalog.
Economics and History
The joint major in economics and history makes an important contribution to liberal education at Vanderbilt by
helping students understand the origins and organization of modern society. It also provides a unique preparation for
careers in business, the professions, and other fields by combining all the analytical tools of the regular economics
major with history’s emphasis on clear and effective writing and on developing skills in gathering, assessing, and
synthesizing information. The program consists of 45 credit hours of course work: 9 credit hours in an economic
history core, and an additional 18 credit hours in economics and 18 in history. Students declare their major through
the Department of History office.
 
Note: One semester of calculus is a prerequisite for ECON 1500 and 1510. MATH 1201 (or MATH 1301) is a
prerequisite for Economics courses numbered 3000 and above.
 
The description of the Concentration in Economics and History below will apply to students who
matriculate at Vanderbilt in August 2018 and thereafter.
 
Page 364 of 1019 

Course work for the major is distributed as follows:
 
Economic History Core (9 credit hours)
Three of the following courses, one of which must be an economics course above 3000:
 
HIST 1039, 1352, 1600, 1640, 1660, 1665, 2106, 2107, 2138, 2150, 2255, 2660, 2700, 2710, 3190, 3200, ECON
2150, 3150, 3160, RUSS 2810.
 
Note: ECON 3012 is a prerequisite for ECON 3150, and 3160.
 
Economics (18 credit hours)
ECON 1010, 1020, 1500 or 1510, 3012, 3022; one ECON course above 3022 not included in the economic history
core.
 
Note: The following course sequences may be substituted for ECON 1500 or 1510: Option 1: MATH 2810, 2820L, and
either ECON 3032 or 3035.
Option 2: MATH 2820, 2820L, and either ECON 3032 or 3035. In these cases, ECON 3032 or 3035 will also count as
an elective.
 
History (18 credit hours)
No more than 3 credit hours of AP or IB credit in history courses may count toward this total.
1. History 3000W or 3980; must be taken by the end of the junior year. 3980 is limited to second-semester
juniors who have been admitted to the Honors Program. Students entering the Honors Program who have
already earned credit for 3000W will receive elective credit for that course.
2. History 4960 (prerequisite: History 3000W), or History 4980–4981 (available only to students in the Honors
Program). Note: At the discretion of the director of honors and the director of undergraduate studies in
history, a student who has earned credit for 4980 but does not take 4981 may be considered to have fulfilled
the capstone requirement for the major.
3. Four other history courses. Electives may include any courses, not used to satisfy any of the above
requirements, offered by the Department of History, including any courses listed for the history major.
Honors Program (9 more credit hours)
Students apply to the Honors Program in History in the first semester of the junior year.
 
54 credit hours: students will take the four-course honors sequence, HIST 3980, 4980–4981, 4999. Because HIST
4980–4981 satisfies the capstone requirement, honors students will not be required to take HIST 4960, though they
may enroll for 4960 as an elective. Students will write an interdisciplinary thesis under the direction of an adviser
from each department.

The Division of Engineering Science and Management administers the engineering science major, the engineering
management minor, and the first-year introduction to engineering course. The division oversees non-traditional
engineering study and advises students on course selection to meet specific career goals that traditional
engineering majors may not provide.
 
COURSES OFFERED: ENGM, ES
Engineering Science Major (Bachelor of Science)
The engineering science major is flexible and interdisciplinary—offering students the opportunity to select a program
of study to meet special interests or objectives. Many students choose a program of study in engineering
management, communication of science and technology, various engineering concentrations, environmental
science or materials  science; however, students may develop unique plans of study to specialize in areas for which
facilities and faculty competence exist but which are not covered within a single existing degree program at
Vanderbilt. Engineering science graduates may establish careers in engineering or science, interface with engineers
(e.g., in marketing and sales), or use their analytical and problem-solving skills to build future professional careers.
Defined areas of concentration exist in engineering management, communication of science and technology,
secondary education, and materials science and engineering. Individual programs have been developed for students
interested in careers in engineering mathematics, environmental engineering, transportation engineering, teaching,
technical communications, and other areas requiring nontraditional combinations of engineering courses. Because
of the flexible nature of the engineering science programs of study, accreditation has not been sought for these
programs of study, and engineering science majors will not qualify for engineering licensure in most states.
 
Engineering Management. Engineering management is an interdisciplinary program of study designed to give
students the tools to manage technology development and innovation, to enhance manufacturing quality and
productivity in a competitive international environment, and to implement these objectives successfully in an
Page 372 of 1019 

organization. Engineering management links engineering, science, and the management disciplines. In addition to
the core science and math courses required of all engineering students, topics of study include entrepreneurship,
human resources management, finance in technology-based organizations, technology strategy, communications,
and operations.
 
Communication of Science and Technology. Many careers that are attractive to graduates of the engineering science
program require the communication of engineering and science to people who are not technically trained. The
Communication of Science and Technology interdisciplinary program prepares engineering students for careers in
areas such as technical consulting, high-technology marketing and sales, environmental law, and journalism. The
program combines traditional engineering and science courses with communications and humanities courses in a
flexible curriculum. Engineering science majors may select from a set of program electives identified by the faculty
committee of the School of Engineering and the College of Arts and Science that supervises the program.
 
Minors. Students may also pursue a minor consisting of at least five courses of at least three credit hours within a
recognized area of knowledge. Minors are offered in engineering management, materials science and engineering,
computer engineering, electrical engineering, computer science, scientific computing, environmental engineering,
energy and environmental systems, nanoscience and nanotechnology, and most disciplines within the College of
Arts and Science. Students must declare their intention to pursue minors by completing forms available in the Office
of Academic Services of the School of Engineering.
Curriculum Requirements
The B.S. in engineering science requires a minimum of 122 hours, distributed as follows:
1. Basic Science (16 hours). CHEM 1601, 1601L plus 12 hours from BSCI 1510, 1510L, 1511, 1511L; CHEM 1602,
1602L; PHYS 1601, 1601L, 1602, 1602L; or MSE 1500, 1500L with two courses in a single discipline.

6. Program Concentration (24 hours). In consultation with the academic adviser, each student must identify a
meaningful sequence of courses, not counting certain introductory-level courses, that directly contributes to
meeting stated career goals. Program concentrations are approved by the academic adviser and the program
director in advance and become part of the student’s degree audit.
The preparation provided by the program concentration, together with a solid foundation in basic engineering
courses, provides the engineering science student a strong and useful career base.
 
No more than 24 credit hours of business-related course work (BUS, BUSA, ENGM, FNEC, MGRL) may be applied to
the ES degree program. Only one business-related minor (BUS, ENGM, FNEC, MGRL, HOD) may count to a student’s
academic program. No more than 6 credit hours of courses numbered 3840 to 3879 in any program may be applied
to the ES degree program.
 
Undergraduates in engineering science may apply the pass/ fail option only to courses taken as liberal arts core or
open electives, subject to the school requirements for pass/fail. UNIV courses are eligible for open elective credit
only. Credit for the senior capstone sequence (4 hours) satisfies the Immersion Vanderbilt requirement.

COURSES OFFERED: ENGL
 
The Department of English offers three distinct programs that allow students to individualize their studies while
acquiring the breadth of knowledge and skills of the traditional English major. The curriculum provides courses in the
history of British and American literature, film, digital media, Anglophone literatures of other countries, literary
theory, and expository as well as creative writing. These diverse courses reflect the interests of students and faculty
and the expanding area of English literary study. Students use the concentration in English as a foundation for
careers ranging from education, law, business, and government to public relations and the media industry-anywhere
that analytic, reading, and writing skills are valued-and as preparation for postgraduate work in literature. The
department also regards helps students become lifelong readers of literature and culture.
 
Programs in England, Scotland, Australia, and around the world offer opportunities for study and travel that enrich a
student’s education. The Gertrude Vanderbilt and Harold S. Vanderbilt Visiting Writers series annually sponsors
public lectures, readings, and other occasions where English majors hear and meet celebrated poets, novelists, and
critics. Many majors write for and serve on the editorial boards of campus publications including the Hustler , the
Vanderbilt Review, a distinguished collection of creative writing, and Vanderbilt Lives, an annual publication of
creative non-fiction by Vanderbilt Undergraduates. An English major listserv alerts students to employment
opportunities, internships, and study abroad programs in addition to those offered through Vanderbilt University.

B.E. in environmental engineering. The curriculum includes analysis and design courses in environmental
engineering. Vanderbilt’s B.E. in environmental engineering prepares students for entry-level positions in many
specialty areas of environmental engineering, as well as a variety of other careers, such as business, government,
and law. The major will provide students with the tools necessary to develop effective solutions to solve emerging
and existing issues such as water resources, quality, and treatment; aging infrastructures; climate change and
carbon neutral innovations; energy and material resources; wastes and pollution; and other environmental
challenges. Recognizing that environmental solutions cannot be realized without consideration of social, cultural,
economic, and political factors, students will be required to extend the breadth of their studies with courses in data
science and global perspectives courses in social sciences, economics, political sciences, and the humanities.  These
will be in addition to foundational courses in the basic and applied sciences, mathematics, engineering, and
advanced courses in fate, transport, and treatment of contaminants in the environment. The curriculum culminates
with a senior design project in which students will have the opportunity to draw on and integrate the broad
knowledge they have gained from the data science and global perspectives courses with the science and
engineering knowledge they gained in the major. Due to the complex interdisciplinary nature of the field, many
undergraduate students continue their environmental engineering education and earn either a professional (MEng)
degree or a graduate (MS or PhD) degree. 
 
Undergraduate Honors Program. The Honors Program in environmental engineering provides an opportunity for
selected students to develop individually through independent study and research. The environmental engineering
honors program requires a minimum overall GPA of 3.5. Acceptance to the program is made by petition to the
faculty during the junior year. Transfer students may be considered for admission after completing one semester at
Vanderbilt. Candidates for honors choose their technical courses with the consent of a faculty honors adviser. A
three-credit hour independent study course and a summer research internship with a final report and presentation
given in the spring semester of the senior year to the ENVE faculty and students are required. The independent
study course may also be counted towards the environmental engineering technical electives. The diploma
designation is Honors in Environmental Engineering.
 
Facilities: The environmental laboratories are fully supplied with modern instrumentation for chemical, physical,
biological, and radiological analysis of soils, sediments, water, wastewater, air, and solid waste. They include
equipment for the study of biological waste treatment, physical-chemical waste treatment, contaminant mass
transfer, and state-of-the-art instrumentation.   All are available for student use in courses, demonstrations, and
research. 
 
Undergraduates in environmental engineering may apply the pass/fail option only to courses taken as open or
liberal arts core electives, subject to the school requirements for pass/fail.

COURSES OFFERED: EUS
 
Designed for students with an interest in European culture, politics, and society, the Program in European Studies
(EUS) offers a range of survey and in-depth courses that shed a light on the European project, its global impact, and
its challenges. A combination of core courses enables students to analyze Europe’s past as well as its many
contemporary facets. EUS elective courses broaden the understanding of Europe’s diverse cultural tradition and
political developments and lay the foundation for careers in international law, geo-politics, cultural administration,
and other professions that deal with international affairs.
 
The Program in European Studies sponsors events and workshops, including a visiting lecture series, international
symposia, and informal faculty-student luncheon seminars, in conjunction with the Max Kade Center for European
and German Studies.
 
EUS offers an immersive encounter with different cultures. Students majoring in EUS fulfill specific language
requirements and many choose to study one or two semesters in a European country at pre-approved programs.
Program of Concentration in European Studies (27-30 credit hours)
Students with an interest in European culture, politics, and societies choose from a set of overview courses to
deepen their understanding of historical and contemporary European topics, select up to five additional electives in
EUS, and fulfill language requirements to ascertain their training in intercultural literacy. The major prepares for
careers in international law, politics, and diplomacy as well as in cultural administration with the visit of advanced
studies or Ph.D. programs. Most EUS majors participate in approved study abroad programs in Europe. Active
participation is expected in events and activities, such as guest lectures, symposia, and luncheons, organized by
EUS in conjunction with the Max Kade Center for European and German Studies.
 
Required Core Courses (9 credit hours)
EUS 2201, European Society and Culture or EUS 2203, The Idea of Europe (3 credit hours)
EUS 2202, European Politics
EUS 2204, European Cultural History
Foreign Language Requirement (6 credit hours)
 
The foreign language requirement is to be satisfied in one of the following ways:
6 credit hours of course work at the intermediate level in one European language;
course work through the beginner level in two European languages;
Page 381 of 1019 

demonstration of proficiency equivalent to either of the preceding options; or
participation in one of the Vanderbilt intensive-language programs in Europe (students participating in
Vanderbilt's predominantly English-language program in Europe must complete course work through the
intermediate level in one European language, or demonstrate equivalent proficiency).
European languages recognized for the major include Albanian, Bulgarian, Czech, Croatian/Bosnian/Serbian, Danish,
Finnish, French, German, Greek, Hungarian, Ladino (Judeo-Spanish), Italian, Norwegian, Polish, Portuguese, Romani,
Romanian, Russian, Slovak, Spanish, Swedish, Turkish, Ukrainian and Yiddish. Other languages may be approved by
the major adviser.
 
Independent Study (3 credit hours)
Students will complete EUS 3850, Independent Readings and Research supervised by a professor in EUS or outside
the program with expertise in the field; normally completed in the junior or senior year.
 
Electives (12–18 credit hours)
Students choose four courses in EUS (usually above EUS 2204; an additional core course may count as one elective).
No more than two courses may be substituted by courses taken outside of EUS either from individually approved
courses or courses taken abroad with the approval of the DUS. Students majoring in EUS are advised to select
courses from the social sciences and humanities that complement their areas of special interest and thematic focus.
 
Other Issues Relating to the Major
Normally, no more than 6 credit hours of work in 1000-level courses may be counted toward the major. However,
students who have fulfilled their language requirements by demonstrating equivalent proficiency or through
participation in a Vanderbilt approved study program in Europe may count up to two 1000- and/or 2000-level
language courses in a European language toward their major.
 
Students seeking a second major may count a maximum of 6 credit hours of course work to meet requirements in
both majors.
Honors Program
The Program in European Studies offers qualified majors the option of completing a portion of their major
requirements in an Honors Program. Students engage in interdisciplinary reading, consultations with faculty, and
research on the overarching theme of their program of concentration. To be admitted to the program students must
have attained a minimum cumulative grade point average of 3.300 and a minimum grade point average of 3.300 in
all courses that count toward the EUS major; identify an adviser for the honors thesis; submit a detailed description
of their proposed program of study for approval by the director of EUS; complete 3 credit hours of independent
research (normally EUS 4998); complete 3 credit hours of credit in EUS 4960, Senior Tutorial, that involves
researching and writing a senior honors thesis of approximately fifty pages; successfully defend the honors thesis
before a committee normally consisting of the adviser, the director of EUS, and another faculty member. Information
concerning the Honors Program is available from the director of EUS. College regulations governing honors
programs may be found in this catalog under Honors Programs, Special Programs for Arts and Science.
The Minor in European Studies
The EUS minor is a good complement to a major in anthropology, economics, history, literary studies, philosophy,
and political science. It consists of a minimum of 18 credit hours of course work and requires students to take three
of the EUS core courses and three electives from the EUS catalog. One of the major electives may be replaced by a
course from another department or program with the prior approval of the director of EUS. A background in a
modern foreign language is highly recommended.

COURSES OFFERED: GSS
 
The Department of Gender and Sexuality Studies offers an interdisciplinary curriculum that examines the formation
of gender and its intersections with other relations of power, such as sexuality, race, ability, class, nationality,
religion, locality and age. The department encourages students to develop new theoretical approaches and to
transform the analytical tools of many fields of study. Our courses and instructors pay particular attention to how
lives are impacted by systemic inequalities. The goal of our scholarship, teaching, and activism is to make gender
and sexuality central rather than peripheral terms of analysis. Our curriculum compels us to recognize the problems
and possibilities of our current world and also empowers us to affect change. The Department of Gender and
Sexuality Studies offers a major and a minor, and a graduate certificate, which provide a foundation for students who
plan to enter professional schools in law, medicine, business, the humanities, and the social sciences.
 
Program of Concentration in Gender and Sexuality Studies
The interdisciplinary major in gender and sexuality studies consists of 30–36 credit hours of course work, distributed
at the Introductory, Intermediate, and Advanced levels, as follows:
 
Introductory-Level Courses (3 credit hours)

The department sponsors lectures on topics related to German, Russian and East European society and culture,
films, symposia, and other German- and Russian-themed activities. Students are encouraged to apply for living
space in McTyeire International House in the German and Russian sections. German Studies majors with sufficient
academic qualifications are invited to join Delta Phi Alpha, the national German honor society. Russian Studies
majors with sufficient qualifications are invited to join Dobro Slovo, the national Slavic honor society.
 
Many students majoring in German Studies enroll in study abroad programs in Bremen or Freiburg, Germany. Less
formal activities, such as a weekly Kaffeestunde or the Stammtisch at a local pizza parlor, are also open to
undergraduates. For further information, please see as.vanderbilt.edu/grees.
 
The Russian and East European Studies program has a special commitment to undergraduate training in all aspects
of Russian language and the cultures and histories of the larger region. Students have several possibilities for
studying abroad in Russia, including summer-, semester- and year-long programs in Moscow and St. Petersburg,
where they have the option of studying history, politics, economics and/or culture alongside the Russian
language. For further information, please see as.vanderbilt.edu/grees.

COURSES OFFERED: HIST
 
More than one hundred courses in the Department of History are available to Vanderbilt undergraduates. Some
focus on a particular historical period, others on a particular region of the world, and still others on topics that may
cross traditional chronological and geographical boundaries. The department is committed to the principle that in a
changing world, the way we learn about the past must also change. It will continue to develop new courses for the
twenty-first century, with an emphasis on those that recognize the interconnections among the various civilizations
and regions of the globe.
 
Unless indicated otherwise in the course description, history courses have no prerequisite. Except for History 3980,
4960, 4980–4981, and 4999, courses numbered below 5000 are open to all majors and nonmajors. History 4960 is
limited to seniors and juniors who have previously taken History 3000W. History 3980, 4980–4981, and 4999 are
limited to students who have been admitted to the History Honors Program.
 
Students will find that the study of history offers not only a strong foundation for a liberal education but also a
means of understanding the contemporary world. The skills developed in gathering, assessing, and synthesizing
information have wide application in many careers, including business and the professions.
 
The Department of History offers a major and minor in history; a major in law, history, and society; and, in
cooperation with the Department of Economics, a joint major in economics and history, which is described in this
catalog under Economics and History.

Program of Concentration in Law, History, and Society
As a human institution self-consciously aware of its past, “The Law” raises a complex set of issues that can be
addressed historically. Legislation and jurisprudence, for example, allow historians a privileged perspective into how
societies sought to define themselves, their values, and their membership. Constitutions provide maps of political
power, and serve as sites of struggle over goods both real and symbolic. Records of legal practice are often well
preserved, allowing access to the voices and actions of people who are usually left out of systems of political
organization.
 
This major approaches law from both a historical and an interdisciplinary perspective. Emphasis will be placed on
close reading of legal documents, research in legal archives, and analytical writing. Students will be encouraged to
develop reading programs and research topics that stretch across national and chronological boundaries, and to
think comparatively. Students may not major both in history and in law, history, and society. Students majoring in
law, history, and society may apply to receive honors through the History Honors Program.
 
The major program requires a minimum of 30 credit hours in history; no more than 3 credit hours of AP or IB credit
may count toward this total. Note: AP and IB credit will not count toward the 15 credit hours for the concentration.
No more than 6 credit hours may be from courses outside the Department of History.
 
Course work is distributed as follows:
 
1. History Workshop. 3000W or 3980 (3 credit hours)
Note: 3000W is a prerequisite for the 4960 capstone course. 3980 is limited to second-semester juniors who have

Honors Program
The Honors Program in History is a three-semester program of study. It offers superior undergraduate history majors
a program of advanced reading, research, and writing. The Honors Program combines seminar work and
independent study under the supervision of a thesis adviser. This structure provides participants an introduction to
historical research and writing, as well as the opportunity to study defined areas of history and significant historical
problems that accord with their own interests. The final objectives of the Honors Program are successful authorship
of the honors thesis and graduation with honors or highest honors in the major.
 
Students apply to the Honors Program in the first semester of the junior year. Students meeting college and
departmental requirements will enroll for a total of 12 credit hours: History 3980, Junior Honors Seminar in History (3
credit hours); History 4980–4981 Senior Honors Research Seminar (6 credit hours); and 4999, Senior Honors Thesis
(3 credit hours). In addition, the Honors Program requires an oral defense of the honors thesis before a faculty
committee at the end of the third semester.
 
Program of Concentration in Economics and History
This is an interdisciplinary program split between economics and history that provides a more focused program of
study while requiring fewer credit hours than a double major in the two fields. See the Economics and History
section of this catalog for details.
 
Licensure for Teaching
Candidates for teacher licensure in history at the secondary level should refer to the chapter on Licensure for
Teaching in the Peabody College section of this catalog.
 
Minor in History
The minor in history requires a minimum of 18 credit hours in courses that are offered by the Department of History
Page 400 of 1019 

or that are listed above in programs A–G of the history major, among which no more than two courses may be
outside the Department of History. At least 9 credit hours must be taken at the 2000 level or higher. Students must
complete 3000W. No more than 3 credit hours of AP or IB credit may count toward this total.

COURSES OFFERED: HART
 
The Department of History of Art and Architecture treats critically the major fields in world art, from ancient to
contemporary, and connects the arts to the other humanities. Many students will use the program in history of art
and architecture as a foundation for careers in which analytical reading and writing skills gained in the major are
especially valued: as the basis for advanced training in professional schools (such as architecture, law, medicine,
journalism, and business), for postgraduate work in history of art or architecture, and for employment in galleries,
museums, or design-related fields. The department helps students become readers of visual images and material
culture throughout their lives, and encourages visual approaches to learning. In addition, the department provides
practical experience in research, writing, and exhibition organization that are key to pursuing museum and gallery
careers, as well as courses in museum studies.
 
Majors in history of art and architecture participate in the activities of the Vanderbilt History of Art Society, the
student architecture group, and work closely with departmental advisers. The History of Art Society and the
department sponsor events such as panels, lectures, debates, and other programs where majors meet and engage
in discussions with historians of art and museum curators.
 
The department curriculum complements those of related departments and programs, including African American
and Diaspora Studies, American Studies, Anthropology, Asian Studies, Cinema and Media Arts, Classical and
Mediterranean Studies, European Studies, Gender and Sexuality Studies, Latin American, Caribbean, and Latinx
Studies, and Religious Studies.
 
Page 401 of 1019 

The Department of History of Art and Architecture offers a major and minor in history of art, and a major and minor
in architecture and the built environment.
Program of Concentration in History of Art
The history of art major requires 30 credit hours and gives students the opportunity to study art and visual culture
across a wide range of historical periods, from ancient to contemporary. The program is designed to allow for
concentration in particular periods and areas of interest. By requiring courses in both the lecture and seminar
format, the program aims to provide a basis of comprehensive knowledge and challenging opportunities for more
specialized instruction.
 
Students should consider related offerings in cognate disciplines in the humanities and social sciences. Those
planning graduate work in history of art should pursue advanced studies—which may include honors—and take
advanced courses in other departments offering complementary course work. Advanced language studies are
strongly recommended, as graduate programs expect reading facility in one language for the M.A. and two for the
Ph.D., with French and German the most commonly required. Non-European languages should be considered for
those primarily interested in global traditions.
 
Course work is distributed as follows:
A 1000-level course (3 credit hours): Students must complete one 1000-level survey course in history of art
or architecture selected from HART 1100, 1105, 1120, 1121, 1122, 1200, 1205, 1220, 1300, or 1400. This
course is not a prerequisite for further history of art course work but must be taken at Vanderbilt; AP credit
will not be accepted.

Program of Concentration in Architecture and the Built Environment
The track in architecture and the built environment requires 30 credit hours and promotes interdisciplinary and
trans-institutional study. It enables students to develop breadth and expertise in the history and theory of
architecture, landscape architecture, and constructed environments; design studies; and theoretical and historical
approaches to analyzing urban scale and city planning. Students can build a foundation for graduate work in these
fields as well as for spatially related specializations in cognate disciplines such as anthropology, political science,
public policy, sociology, demography, public health, environmental studies, civil engineering, computer science, and
geography and geographic information systems.
 
Course work is distributed as follows:
1. A 1000-level course (3 credit hours): Students must complete one 1000-level survey course in history of art

Honors Program
The honors program in history of art and architecture allows exceptional undergraduate students to undertake
independent research on a topic in art or architectural history in consultation with faculty members. The program is
open to all history of art and architecture majors with junior standing who have earned a 3.30 grade point average
in all university courses and a 3.30 grade point average in history of art courses. They must also be approved for
acceptance into the honors program by the department faculty. Completion of the program requires 9 credit hours
of study: HART 3850, Independent Research (the second semester of the junior year, unless studying abroad, in
which case one is expected to enroll in this class the first semester of the junior year); HART 4998, Honors Research
(first semester of the senior year); and HART 4999, Honors Thesis (second semester of the senior year); submission
of an honors thesis; and successful completion of an oral defense of the thesis. These independent research credit
hours are in addition to the 30 credit hours required for the major in history of art or architecture and the built
environment. Students meeting these requirements receive honors or highest honors in history of art or architecture
and the built environment, depending on the quality of the thesis, grades in history of art and architecture courses,
and defense results. Successful departmental honors students will receive a Vanderbilt diploma that records honors
or highest honors in history of art or architecture and the built environment.
 
Minor in History of Art
The minor in history of art requires 18 credit hours of course work, including the following:
 
Two 1000-level courses from 1100, 1105, 1120, 1121, 1122, 1200, 1205, 1220, 1300, 1400 or CLAS 1020, plus any

Honors
COURSES OFFERED: HONS
 
Courses designated “Honors” are parts of a special honors program in liberal education called the College Scholars
program. They may be taken only by students who have been appointed College Scholars by the dean of the
College of Arts and Science. Some College Scholars are appointed before they arrive for their first semester in
residence; others may be appointed on the basis of their records in that first semester. All first-year students in the
College of Arts and Science may apply to the associate dean for honors programs for admission to the College
Scholars program; only first-year students are considered for admission.
 
Honors seminars offered in the College Scholars program provide an especially interesting and challenging way for
College Scholars to complete certain parts of the program for Achieving Excellence in Liberal Education (AXLE).
 
They are designed to cover topics through the intensive analysis afforded by the seminar setting and format. An
honors seminar will satisfy the requirement for a first-year writing seminar. Honors 1810W, 1820W, 1830W, 1840W,
1850W, and 1860W count toward the AXLE requirements identified by the seminars’ titles. Honors 1810W are
Humanities and the Creative Arts (HCA) courses; Honors 1820W are Perspectives (P) courses; Honors 1830W are
Social and Behavioral Sciences (SBS) courses; Honors 1840W are History and Culture of the United States (US)
courses; Honors 1850W are Mathematics and Natural Sciences (MNS) courses; Honors 1860W are International
Cultures (INT) courses.
 
In addition to regular credit hours and grade points, honors seminars carry honors points toward graduation with the
designation “Honors in the College of Arts and Science.” College Scholars must earn fifteen honors points to receive
that designation (they are not required to earn this designation but may take as many honors seminars as they
wish).
 
They may earn up to thirteen of the required fifteen points in honors seminars: three points each for the first time
they take Honors 1810W, 1820W, 1830W, 1840W, 1850W, or 1860W; one point if they take a second seminar in the
same area. Single honors points may be earned (a) in departmental honors sections of regular courses, (b) in
independent project approved by the associate dean for honors programs, and (c) in a regular course in which an
enriched curriculum approved by the Committee on the Honors Program is pursued. Honors points are only earned
for courses in which the student earns the grade B or better.

Interdisciplinary Studies
Any student who is at least a sophomore and in good academic standing may earn one credit hour per semester or
summer for an internship completed under the designation INDS 3880/3884 (summer) exclusively on a Pass/Fail
basis. This course may be repeated twice for a maximum of three credit hours. Students are responsible for
obtaining their own internship and faculty adviser. The student and faculty adviser work together to plan the
academic project associated with the internship. Their agreement must be approved by Associate Dean Daniel
Morgan.

Jewish Studies at Vanderbilt offers an interdisciplinary academic program that facilitates the critical study of Jewish
history, religion, language, philosophy, politics, culture, society, music, art, and literature across continents and over
three millennia. Integral to understanding crucial moments in the formation of Christianity and Islam as well as
distinct episodes in the cultures of the modern Middle East, Europe, and America, the program accesses the
resources of the entire university to explore Judaism, its evolution and expression from biblical times to the present.
This interdisciplinary program reflects Vanderbilt’s commitment to advancing the understanding of diverse cultures
and traditions. Students of all backgrounds will find in Jewish Studies at Vanderbilt a wide array of material and
methodologies, presented by scholars from history, anthropology, sociology, religious studies, philosophy, literature,
and history of art. Students may focus on several areas of concentration and tailor the major to their academic and
career interests. They also have access to courses offered by the schools of divinity, education, and music; they
have access to the Zimmerman Judaica collection as well as the opportunity to study abroad, pursue internships
locally or nationally, and do research in archives overseas. The interdisciplinary nature of Jewish Studies offers
excellent preparation for graduate studies and provides an outstanding academic foundation for a variety of
rewarding career paths. Visit as.vanderbilt.edu/jewishstudies for more details.

COURSES OFFERED: LATS
 
Latino and Latina Studies focuses on cultural production and political and socioeconomic experiences of people
inculcated with the US experience, self-identifying as Latinx and communicating primarily in English and sometimes
in Spanish. The LATS major and minor will examine this enduring and dynamic population that crosses and re-
crosses borders constructed by geography, linguistics, class, race, and gender. This program of study is designed to
accommodate a range of voices and multiple manifestations of Latinx identity and cultural expression in historical
and contemporary contexts to fill in this vital but often overlooked component of our national identity and discourse.
Students pursuing a LATS major or minor are expected to obtain language competence in Spanish before
completing the program, though they do not need to meet this requirement when declaring the major or minor.
Students may satisfy this requirement by completing SPAN 3303, or any other course with a higher number taught
in Spanish.
 
Program of Concentration in Latino and Latina Studies
The interdisciplinary major in Latino and Latina studies consists of thirty-six (36) credit hours. The specific
requirements are as follows:
1. LATS 2201, Introduction to Latino and Latina Studies (3 credit hours)
2. SPAN 3303, Introduction to Spanish and Spanish American Literature (3 credit hours)
Page 416 of 1019 

SPAN 3303 requires up to 19 prerequisite credit hours of Spanish language instruction through SPAN 3302,
depending on departmental placement.
3. ENGL 3658, Latino-American Literature (3 credit hours)
4. LATS 4961, Latino and Latina Studies Capstone, which is usually taken in the senior year (3 credit hours)

COURSES OFFERED: MATH
 
The Department of Mathematics offers an undergraduate major with a high degree of flexibility. A solid background
in mathematics provides an excellent foundation for any quantitative discipline as well as many professions—many
students go on to professional studies in law, medicine, or business.
 
Program of Concentration in Mathematics
Three tracks are available.
Program I (Standard Track) is intended for most mathematics majors in the College of Arts and Science, Blair School
of Music, and Peabody College.
 
Program II (Applied Track) is intended for students in the School of Engineering who elect a second major in
mathematics but is also available for other students.
 
Program III (Honors Track) is intended for highly qualified students who either are preparing for graduate studies in
mathematics or plan to graduate with departmental honors. Students who complete this program and, in addition,
complete a senior thesis will graduate with departmental honors.

4. The remainder of the 21 credit hours must be chosen from 2800 or above, excluding 4999.
4. The remainder of the credit hours must be chosen from 2800 or above.
Students who complete Program III and, in addition, fulfill the Honors requirements listed below, will graduate with
departmental honors.
 
Students planning to teach in secondary school should contact the director of secondary education programs in the
Department of Teaching and Learning at Peabody College for course recommendations.
 
Honors Program
The Honors Program in Mathematics is designed to afford superior students the opportunity to pursue more
intensive work within their major field. The program requires:
1. Completion of all the requirements of Program III (Honors Track).
2. Graduate with a minimum grade point average of 3.6 in courses that count toward the mathematics
3. Completion of a senior thesis, typically in the second semester of the senior year. With approval of the
director of undergraduate studies, the thesis may be based on research initiated or completed at another
academic institution, such as during a summer REU
4. Oral examination on the senior thesis. A committee of at least three faculty members—at least two from the
Department of Mathematics, one being the thesis adviser—shall evaluate the thesis and the oral examination.
Exceptional achievement on the thesis will earn highest
Interested students may apply to the director of undergraduate studies for admission to the Honors Program in their
junior year or the first semester of their senior year. Applicants must meet college requirements for entry to the
Honors Program and must maintain a minimum grade point average of 3.6 in courses that count toward the
mathematics major.
 
The application includes a one- to two-page proposal of the planned thesis and the signature of the faculty member
who will be the thesis adviser.
The thesis must be submitted no later than two weeks before the end of classes in the semester of graduation. The
oral examination will take place by the last day of classes in the semester of graduation. Highest honors will be
awarded for a thesis that contains original high-quality research results in combination with an oral defense at the
highest quality level.
 
Students may sign up for Math 4999 during one semester of their senior year. Math 4999 will not count toward the
21 credit hours requirement in Program III.
 
Please consult the director of undergraduate studies for details.
 
Minor in Mathematics
The minor in mathematics requires at least 15 credit hours in mathematics, including:
1. Completion of a calculus sequence: 2300, 2310, or 2500–2501.
2. Linear algebra and differential equations: as in the Program II major.
Page 421 of 1019 

3. At least 6 credit hours not used to satisfy item 2 from 2800 or above.
Completion of a single-variable calculus sequence (1300–1301) is a prerequisite for the minor, but does not count
toward the credit hours of the minor.
 
Licensure for Teaching
Candidates for teacher licensure at the secondary level in mathematics should refer to the chapter on Licensure for
Teaching in the Peabody College section of this catalog.
 
Calculus
Several calculus sequences are available: 1100; 1200–1201; 1300–1301–2300; 1300-1301-2310.
 
The courses in these sequences cover similar material, but at different rates, and therefore overlap in content and
credit. Students should not switch from one to another without approval of the department. Such switching may
result in loss of credit. Students intending to take mathematics classes beyond one year of calculus are advised to
enroll in the 1300–1301–2300 sequence or in the 1300-1301-2310 sequence.
 
First-year students with test scores of 5 on the Calculus BC advanced placement examination, thereby earning AP
credit for 1300–1301, may choose to enroll in the 2500–2501 sequence. The combination of 2500–2501 is a blend of
multivariable calculus and linear algebra, with an emphasis on rigorous proofs.

COURSES OFFERED: ME
 
The vitality of our nation depends upon innovation in the design of new machines, devices to satisfy society’s needs,
engines to produce power efficiently, equipment to condition the environment of our buildings, and the systems to
use and control these engineered products. Mechanical engineers are involved in solving problems by originating
design concepts, developing products and processes of manufacture, and designing hardware and the systems
needed to satisfy society’s demands. Mechanical engineers work in virtually all industries.
 
The study of mechanical engineering requires a basic understanding of mathematics, chemistry, physics, and the
engineering sciences. Mechanical engineering education emphasizes solid mechanics; dynamics of machines;
aerodynamics; propulsion devices; material behavior; power producing and environmental conditioning processes;
control of dynamics of machines; energy conversion; and the synthesis, development, evaluation, and optimization
of designs of devices and systems.

COURSES OFFERED: NANO
 
Faculty in the School of Engineering and the College of Arts and Science offer an interdisciplinary minor in
nanoscience and nanotechnology. The minor is administered by the School of Engineering.
 
Nanoscience and nanotechnology are based on the ability to synthesize, organize, characterize, and manipulate
matter systematically at dimensions of ~1 to 100 nm, creating uniquely functional materials that differ in properties
from those prepared by traditional approaches. At these length scales, materials can take on new properties that
can be exploited in a wide range of applications such as for solar energy conversion, ultra-sensitive sensing, and
new types of vaccines. These activities require the integration of expertise from various areas of science and
engineering, often relying on methods of synthesis, fabrication, and characterization that are beyond those
Page 435 of 1019 

encountered in an individual course of study.
 
Students who minor in nanoscience and nanotechnology learn the principles and methods used in this rapidly
growing field. Its core originates in the physical sciences by providing key approaches for describing the behavior of
matter on the nanoscale. Synthetic approaches are used to manipulate matter systematically, for creating uniquely
functional nanomaterials that can be inorganic, organic, biological, or a hybrid of these. With a third component of
characterization, a process for designing systems to have particular properties as a result of their composition and
nanoscale arrangement emerges. Students are introduced to these areas through foundational and elective courses
for the minor that are specified below, the latter of which can be selected to fulfill the degree requirements for their
major.
 
The minor in nanoscience and nanotechnology is supported by the Vanderbilt Institute of Nanoscale Science and
Engineering (VINSE) that brings together faculty from the College of Arts and Science, the School of Engineering,
and the Medical Center. A specialized laboratory facility maintained by VINSE provides students in the minor with
capstone experiences that allow them to prepare and characterize a variety of nanostructured systems using in-
house state-of-the-art instrumentation. This hands-on laboratory component enhances the attractiveness of
students to both employers and graduate schools.
Nanoscience and Nanotechnology Minor
The minor in nanoscience and nanotechnology requires a total of 15 credit hours, distributed as follows:
 
1. Nano Core (6 hours). NANO 3000 and one of CHEM 2610 or CHBE 4840 or PHYS 2660.

The study of the nervous system is an interdisciplinary enterprise that draws upon a variety of scientific disciplines
ranging from molecular biology and biophysics to computational science and engineering to the study of behavior
and cognition. To meet the challenge of providing training for entry into this exciting and growing field, Vanderbilt
offers an interdisciplinary program of concentration in neuroscience that utilizes expertise from several departments
within  the university. The program consists of three components. The first provides for a broad foundation in the
basic sciences and mathematics. Second, the program provides for exposure to each of the general areas of
neuroscience including courses in cellular/molecular, systems, and integrative/cognitive neuroscience. This course
work is supplemented with exposure to the laboratory techniques utilized in neuroscience research. Finally, the
program allows students to pursue more work in the specific sub-disciplines of neuroscience and in areas of inquiry
related to neuroscience through elective courses. Students are especially encouraged to participate in research in
the laboratories of neuroscience faculty under the auspices of the undergraduate research courses. More extensive
research experience  is available through the Honors Program in Neuroscience. For additional information, see
as.vanderbilt.edu/neuroscience.
Program of Concentration
The neuroscience major consists of 38 credit hours of course work that includes 8 credit hours of organic chemistry
and 30 credit hours of neuroscience and related courses distributed among specific disciplines associated with the
study of neuroscience. Students majoring in neuroscience are additionally required to complete a core of
introductory courses in mathematics, statistics or computer science, biology and physics that provide the broad
scientific background necessary to the study of neuroscience. The areas and associated course options are listed
below. Excluding research credit (3861, 3862, 3863, 3864, and 4999), the neuroscience and related courses must be
drawn from at least two departments or programs.

COURSES OFFERED: PHIL
 
The Department of Philosophy at Vanderbilt offers a wide range of courses relating philosophy to various dimensions
of human concern. 
The department emphasizes three broad areas of scholarly and teaching excellence: ethics, social and political
philosophy, and the history of philosophy.
Program of Concentration in Philosophy
The program of concentration should be tailored to the needs and interests of the student. The following distribution
of courses is required as part of the major. Logic: 1003 or 3003 (at least 3 credit hours); Ethics: 1005, 3605, 3606, or
3606W (at least 3 credit hours); History of Philosophy: 2100, 2101, 2102, 2103, or 2104 (at least 6 credit hours). Any
alterations must be approved by the director of undergraduate studies. We encourage all majors to work closely
with their advisers to select courses that form a coherent whole. The student must take at least 30 credit hours in
the major field of which at least 21 credit hours must be in courses beyond the 1000 level.
 
Honors Program
The Honors Program offers opportunities for advanced study in philosophy, including independent research projects
and/or enrollment in certain graduate seminars (with permission of the instructor). To be admitted to the program,
the student must: (a) be a major in philosophy; (b) have a grade point average of 3.3 in all courses; (c) have a 3.5
grade point average in philosophy courses; and (d) develop a written proposal for advanced study in consultation
with a philosophy faculty sponsor. Students who satisfy these requirements should meet with the director of
undergraduate studies to review their programs, whereupon the director may nominate the students for honors
work. Honors work typically begins in the junior year or in the first semester of the senior year; students in the
program must complete at least 3 credit hours of Philosophy 3999. Students who successfully complete the program
while maintaining the grade point averages of 3.3 generally, and 3.5 in the major, will receive honors in philosophy;
students who do especially distinguished work will receive highest honors.
 
Minor in Philosophy
The minor in philosophy consists of 18 credit hours, including at least 12 credit hours in courses beyond the 1000
level. The minor program will be constructed so as to provide a broad grounding in philosophy and to complement
the student’s other studies. Each program must be approved by the director of undergraduate studies.
 
Note: 1002 or 1002W or 1005 or 1111 are ordinarily taken prior to all other philosophy courses, except 1003 and
3003 (logic courses), 3616 (philosophy of science), and 3013 (aesthetics).

COURSES OFFERED: ASTR, PHYS
 
As fundamental sciences, physics and astronomy continue to be driving intellectual forces in expanding our
understanding of the universe, in discovering the scientific basis for new technologies, and in applying these
technologies to research. In keeping with this crucial role, the Department of Physics and Astronomy offers courses
dealing with both the cultural and intellectual aspects of the disciplines, a broadly based major program flexible
enough to serve as preparation for graduate study in physics, applied physics, medical physics, astronomy or
astrophysics, professional study in another area, or technical employment, and minor programs for students
desiring to combine physics or astronomy with other majors. An honors program is available for qualified
departmental majors.
 
A distinguishing feature of the Vanderbilt undergraduate curriculum is the close coupling between teaching and
research. At Vanderbilt, active research groups are studying the physics of elementary particles; nuclear structure
and heavy-ion reactions; nonlinear interactions of lasers with materials at ultrafast time scales; the behavior of
electrons, atoms, molecules, and photons near surfaces; the electric and magnetic properties of living systems; the
structure and dynamics of biopolymers; young stars; and cosmology. All professors are engaged in research, and
undergraduate students can participate in this research informally or through independent study or summer work.
Page 441 of 1019 

 
The Society of Physics Students arranges informal discussions.
Program of Concentration in Physics
The departmental major provides a thorough grounding in the core areas of physics. It is suitable either as
preparation for careers in science and engineering or as a springboard for applying technical knowledge in such
fields as business, medicine, law, public policy, and education. The major in the Department of Physics and
Astronomy consists of 31–32 credit hours of course work, distributed as below. Students considering majoring in
physics are strongly encouraged to consult with the director of undergraduate studies before registering for classes.
1. Core courses covering the major subdisciplines of physics — Students must complete four of the following (12
credit hours): Modern Physics and the Quantum World (2255); Classical Mechanics (2275); Electricity,
Magnetism, and Electrodynamics I (2290); Statistical Physics (3200); Quantum Mechanics I (3651).
2. Laboratory work — Students may not use AP credit to satisfy any portion of the laboratory sequence
requirement (3–4 credit hours):
a. Laboratory Principles I (1912L), Laboratory Principles II (2255L), and Introduction to Experimental
Research (2953L); or
b. 1501L or 1601L, 1502L or 1602L, 2255L, and 2953L if the student has entered the major by taking the
introductory physics course sequence 1501 or 1601, 1501L or 1601L, 1502 or 1602, and 1502L or
1602L. Students considering majoring in physics who begin in 1501 or 1601 and 1501L or 1601L in the
fall semester are encouraged to take the combination 1502 + 1912L or 1602 + 1912L in the spring
semester.
3. Electives (9 credit hours) — Pedagogical course work in physics and/or astronomy; research hours (3850,
3851, 4998) do not count toward this requirement. The course electives may be taken from any 2000-level or
higher PHYS or ASTR courses not used to satisfy any other requirement of the major. Other courses may
count as electives, such as courses offered by the engineering school (or other departments and schools) that
are particularly relevant, such as a course in environmental studies, health physics, optics, or materials
science. Such exceptions must be approved by the director of undergraduate studies.
4. Capstone (7 credit hours) — Computational Physics (3790), 3 credit hours of research (3850, 3851, or 4998)
taken across one or more semesters, and the Seminar in Presenting Physics Research (3600). Physics-related
research done in other departments and programs, supervised by Vanderbilt faculty and pre-approved by the
director of undergraduate studies, is also permitted in satisfaction of the research requirement.
Immersion Experience: A student majoring in physics may choose to complete their Immersion Experience through
an enhanced research program within the disciplines of either physics or astronomy. To complete the Immersion
Experience in physics or in astronomy, physics majors must complete at least 5 credit hours of research and earn 1
credit hour from PHYS 3600 (Seminar in Presenting Physics Research) and 3 credit hours from PHYS 3790
(Computational Physics). At least 2 of these credit hours in research must be earned in either 3851 (Undergraduate
Immersion Research) or 4998 (Honors Research). The other three (3) credit hours may be from any combination of
3850, 3851, and 4998. Credit hours in research may be from PHYS, from ASTR, or from a combination of PHYS and
ASTR courses.
 
Computer Science course work: All 2000-level and higher PHYS courses assume students have working skills in
programming. These skills may be learned outside of a regular course, but should be equivalent to that taught in CS
1104 Programming and Problem Solving. Students who do not already have these skills are strongly advised to take
this class in the first semester, prior to beginning the three-semester laboratory sequence in the second semester.
In addition, the following Computer Science and/or Scientific Computing courses are strongly recommended for all
physics majors: Program Design and Data Structures (CS 2201) or Program Design and Data Structures for Scientific
Computing (CS 2204); Algorithms (CS 3250) or Scientific Computing Toolbox (SC 3250); and High Performance
Computing (SC 3260). Physics majors pursuing a second major or minor in computer science should take CS 2201;
physics majors pursuing a minor in scientific computing should take CS 2204.
 
Mathematics course work: All physics majors are expected to have high-level skills in mathematics in order to be
successful in PHYS classes and to prepare for graduate work. MATH courses are not formally required for the major
in physics; however, most physics courses identify MATH prerequisite or co-requisite courses in order to indicate the
mathematical skill-level assumed for that class. Multivariable calculus is a co-requisite for 2255 and a prerequisite for
all other 2000-level or higher PHYS courses. Physics majors are expected to develop a working knowledge of single-
variable calculus, multivariable calculus, and ordinary differential equations. The following courses are those
strongly recommended for physics majors:
Page 442 of 1019 

1. Accelerated Calculus I (1300) and Accelerated Calculus II (1301);
2. Multivariable Calculus (2300) or Multivariable Calculus and Linear Algebra (2500 and 2501); and
3. Methods of Ordinary Differential Equations (2420) or Ordinary Differential Equations (2610).
In addition, for physics majors considering post-graduate work in physics or in a related field, the following PHYS and
MATH courses are strongly recommended as electives:
1. Electricity, Magnetism, and Electrodynamics II (PHYS 2291), Quantum Mechanics II (PHYS 3652),
Mathematical Methods of Physics (PHYS 4005); and
2. Methods of Linear Algebra (MATH 2410) or Linear Algebra (MATH 2600); Introduction to Probability and
Mathematical Statistics (MATH 2820); Statistics Laboratory (MATH 2820L); Complex Variables (MATH 3110);
Introduction to Partial Differential Equations (MATH 3120); Fourier Analysis (MATH 3130); and Advanced
Engineering Mathematics (MATH 3600).
Licensure for Teaching
Candidates for teacher licensure in physics at the secondary level may qualify by taking the basic physics major
together with the requisite education courses described in the chapter on Licensure for Teaching in the Peabody
College section of this catalog.
Honors Program
The Honors Program in the Department of Physics and Astronomy is designed to allow a student to engage in 
advanced research under the guidance of a faculty member, usually in an area related to an ongoing research
program  in the department. A student majoring in physics interested in Honors (Honors in Physics or Honors in
Astronomy) will work with a faculty mentor to develop an appropriate research project that will be conducted under
the guidance of that faculty member. The Honors project must have a substantial grounding in physics or
astronomy, but may be conducted under the direct supervision of any faculty member in any department at
Vanderbilt. To be admitted to the Honors Program, a student must submit a two-page research proposal describing
the plans for their Honors project, which must be approved by the director of the departmental Honors Program. In
addition, a student must have completed 2953L, either 2255 or 3651, and meet the minimum GPA requirements for

Introductory, calculus-based physics is offered at several different levels, each with the appropriate laboratory. Only
one of 1501/1601/1911 and one of 1502/1602/1912 may be taken for credit. Physics 1501–1502/1601L–1602L is
intended for students in the health sciences. Physics 1601–1602/1601L–1602L is intended for students in
engineering. Physics 1911–1912 and the labs 1912L-2255L are intended for students planning to major in physics or
pursue research-oriented careers in science, engineering, or mathematics; however, students may major in physics
after starting in any of these three introductory physics sequences. Prospective majors are strongly advised to
begin their study of physics in the fall semester of their freshman year whenever possible, although with careful
planning it is possible to complete the physics major with a later start. Physics 1010 /1020 is intended for students
without strong backgrounds in mathematics or science who have a general interest in the subject. 1010/1020 is not
recommended as preparation for further study in a natural science, is not appropriate for engineering, premedical,
or pre-dental students, and does not count toward the physics major or minor.

Political Economy
THE Political Economy (PECN) minor is a program that is jointly situated between the Departments of Economics and
Political Science that provides students with the opportunity to engage with the economic analysis of political
institutions and behavior, as well as the analysis of the political consequences of economic decisions, policies, and
outcomes.  Students who minor in Political Economy will acquire a common foundation in tools of microeconomic
theory and game theory, and they will take substantive and methodological coursework to build on these common
analytical foundations to develop expertise in a broad range of topics in political science, economics, and public
policy.
Minor in Political Economy
This interdisciplinary minor requires 18 credit hours divided into two parts: 6 credit hours of required core courses
and 12 credit hours of elective courses, where at least three credit hours of elective courses have to be completed
in Political Science and Economics.
Prerequisites
Students declaring a minor in Political Economy are required to complete either Economics 3012 or Political Science
2259.
1. Core Courses (6 credit hours)
2. Economics 4230/Political Science 3400, Political Economy of Elections
3. Economics 4240, Political Science 3401, Political Economy of Institutions and Development
4. Electives (12 credit hours)
Students are required to complete at least four electives from the following list of courses, where at least one course
must be taken in each of the Departments of Economics and Political Science: ECON 2890, ECON 3032, ECON 3035,
ECON 3110, ECON 3200, ECON 4220, ECON 4260, ECON 4540, PSCI 2211, PSCI 2221, PSCI 2225, PSCI 2226, PSCI
2228W, PSCI 2259, PSCI 2274, PSCI 2300, PSCI 3252, PSCI 3259.
Student Advising
Students who declare a minor in Political Economy will be advised by one of the affiliated faculty, where the
assignment of advisor will depend on whether the student took the required prerequisite for the minor in the
Economics department or the Political Science department. If a student completes her prerequisite by completing
Economics 3012, she will be advised by an affiliated faculty member in the Economics Department, and if she
completes her prerequisite by taking Political Science 2259, she will be advised by an affiliated faculty member in
the Political Science Department.

COURSES OFFERED: PSCI
 
The Department of Political Science is oriented toward both teaching and research and has multiple missions. First,
it offers a balanced curriculum for undergraduates and graduate students to study the art and science of politics.
Second, it offers training for students preparing to become professionals in political science and other fields. Third, it
exists as a research faculty seeking new knowledge about government and politics.
 
Many members of the faculty have national and international reputations in their fields of scholarship. These
research and teaching interests vary widely, from political leadership to the comparison of new and old democratic
governments, issues of political economy, and ethical questions about politics.
 
Political science majors may participate in independent study, directed study, selected topics seminars, first-year
seminars, the Honors Program, and internships. Average class size is close to thirty—small classes make personal
contact with the faculty relatively easy. Students participate in the governance of the department through the
Undergraduate Political Science Association, and may qualify for membership in Pi Sigma Alpha, the national political
science honorary society.
Program of Concentration in Political Science
Students majoring in political science are required to complete a minimum of 30 credit hours of work, distributed as

COURSES OFFERED: PSY
 
Psychology is the scientific study of brain, behavior, and cognitive processes. At Vanderbilt, the undergraduate
program introduces students to the major areas of contemporary psychology: clinical science, human cognition and
cognitive neuroscience, developmental psychology, neuroscience, and social psychology. Clinical science studies
human personality, emotion, abnormal behavior, and therapeutic treatments. Human cognition and cognitive
neuroscience are the study of processes such as learning, remembering, perceiving objects and events, and neural
mechanisms underlying these processes. Developmental psychology examines human development from
conception through adulthood, including cognitive, emotional, physical, and social aspects. Neuroscience studies the
structure and function of the brain and how nerve cells process sensory information, mediate decisions, and control
motor actions. Social psychology examines interpersonal and intergroup relations and the influence of social
conditions on cognitive, emotional, and behavioral processes.
 
The Department of Psychology offers a general program of study for students who desire a broad background in
contemporary psychology, as well as an honors program. The department offers a wide variety of opportunities for
undergraduates to gain research experience through active participation in faculty research projects. Such research
experience is considered a fundamental aspect of education in psychological science.

Honors Program
The Honors Program offers qualified majors the opportunity to conduct research projects in collaboration with
faculty members. This research culminates in the writing and public presentation of a senior thesis.
 
The Honors Program offers unusual opportunities for interested and qualified students, including special seminars
and individual research projects. The program should substantially aid those intending to do graduate work.
 
The program requires three or four semesters of honors research and participation in the Honors Seminars, which
are PSY 3980, 3981, 4998, and 4999. (Students must have at least 9 credit hours total, with mandatory enrollment
in PSY 4999). Students may enroll in the three-semester options of the Honors Program—provided they can
complete the research project by extra work during three regular semesters and/or a summer, and provided this
arrangement is acceptable to the faculty mentor and to the director of the Honors Program. Students who take the
three-semester option will need to take an additional PSY elective course to fulfill their 42 credit hours.
 
Students who are majoring in psychology should apply to the Honors Program at the end of their sophomore year.
 
Applicants are required to have a cumulative grade point average of at least 3.3, both overall and in all courses that
count toward the psychology major. Students must also find a faculty mentor who is willing to sponsor them in the
program. Students who intend to apply the three-semester option should identify a faculty mentor and obtain
permission for the option at the end of their sophomore year, but are not required to apply to the program until the
end of the first term of their junior year. Students who complete the program successfully and have a final
cumulative and major grade point average of 3.3 or higher will receive honors or highest honors in psychology.

Any course in the Department of Psychology (A&S) or the Department of Psychology and Human Development
(Peabody) that is not being used to meet another psychology requirement can be used as an elective, unless
otherwise stated in the course catalog.
 
Comprehensive Exam
In order to graduate with a psychology major, students must take a comprehensive exam during their senior year.
Students are expected to take the comprehensive exam at the beginning of their last semester, typically spring
semester of their senior year. The exam is not graded, and no grade will appear on the student’s transcript. The
purpose of the exam is to assess the extent to which psychology majors are retaining core aspects of the
psychology curriculum.
 
Minor in Psychology
The minor in psychology is intended for those students who want to gain an overview of the science of psychology
and its methodological foundations, and to sample more advanced work in the areas of specialization within
psychology at Vanderbilt.
 
Students are required to complete 18 credit hours of course work inside the department, distributed as follows:
 
PSY 1200
PSY 2100 or PSY-PC 2110 (Peabody)

Independent/Directed Study courses (3850 and 3840/3860) may not be counted as the elective course for minors.
 
1200 (or 1111, sections 1, 2, and 3) is prerequisite for all other psychology courses except 1111. PSY 1111 – 01, 02,
03 – General Psychology, First-Year Writing Seminar – covers the same material as PSY 1200 and also serves as the
introductory prerequisite for all 2000-level courses in psychology. Credit cannot be earned for both PSY 1200 and
PSY 1111 – 01, 02, or 03. PSY 1111– sections 4 and higher – are First-Year Writing Seminars on special topics in
psychology. PSY1111 – sections 4 and higher – do not replace PSY 1200 as a prerequisite for all 2000-level courses
in psychology and may be taken in conjunction with PSY 1200.
 
Note: NSC courses 2201 (Neuroscience), 3235 (Biological Basis of Mental Disorders), 3269 (Developmental

COURSES OFFERED: PPS
Program of Concentration in Public Policy Studies
The public policy studies major has two components: the core curriculum and areas of concentration, and an
optional honors program for those who qualify. Students are also required to complete several prerequisites to
prepare them for the major. Students may not double count any single course for both a required part of the core
and for an elective.
 
The proposed core is interdisciplinary and includes rigorous course work drawn from political science, economics,
sociology, anthropology, and history. The core provides all PPS students training in the politics, economics, methods,
social contexts, history, and ethics of public policy.
 
In addition to developing skills in the core curriculum, PPS students seek more intensive training within areas of
concentration. The boundaries of these areas are not mutually exclusive, and together they span a wide range of
policy concerns and disciplinary perspectives. Among the five elective courses, students must take three courses in
a single area of concentration. It is also recommended that students choose electives from at least two disciplines.
 
Students pursuing the “economic policy” concentration must take at least two upper-level electives in economics
from the list (numbered above 3000).
Prerequisites
PPS majors must have earned credit for MATH 1201 or 1301, or higher; basic statistics (ECON 1500 or 1510 or both
MATH 2820L and either 2810 or 2820); and introductory courses in political science and economics (PSCI 1100,

Faculty in the School of Engineering and the College of Arts and Science offer an interdisciplinary minor in Quantum
Information Science and Engineering. The minor is administered by the College of Arts and Science.
 
Quantum technology is an emerging field that has the potential to revolutionize many areas of science and
technology, from computing to sensing to communication. Quantum mechanics has played an important role in
many areas of engineering for decades now, fueling an increasing number of fundamental breakthroughs, as
available devices become smaller and individual particles can be precisely controlled in the lab. Newly observed
phenomena are often best explained using quantum theory, facilitating new technologies, computational platforms
and applications. A broad view of the diverse aspects of the field is provided: quantum physics, communication,
quantum computation, simulation of physical systems, physics of qubit platforms, hardware technologies.
 
This interdisciplinary program will give undergraduates from chemistry, computer science, electrical engineering,
mathematics, materials science and physics an introduction to the core concepts underlying quantum computing,
communication and sensing. Students will gain experience with quantum hardware and theory that prepares them
for careers in the rapidly evolving quantum engineering industries.

Religious Studies is the critical, academic investigation of diverse spiritual traditions. Religion has always been
active in human affairs for good and for ill, encompassing histories, literatures, politics, cosmologies, and medicines.
Understanding the diversity of religious traditions on their own terms is vital for accuracy in approaching the world's
many challenges. The faculty of Vanderbilt's Religious Studies Department and our many affiliated faculty across
the university provide expertise and research in a variety of religious traditions. In addition to our expertise in
specific religious cultures, texts, practices, rituals, and histories, we also share research interests and teaching focus
on the religious dimensions of race and caste, colonialism, gender and sexuality, health and healing, and the climate
crisis.
 
Students majoring in religious studies gain a deep knowledge of a single tradition, region, or theme and a broad
understanding of religions around the world. Successful students develop a highly portable analytical skill set that
equips them to pursue graduate degrees in religion or cognate disciplines, as well as professional degrees and
careers in fields such as law, diplomacy, medicine, and business. It also provides an excellent second major for a
variety of disciplines that address the human condition including neuroscience; sociology; history; medicine, health,
Page 457 of 1019 

and society; and others. Majors will gain the ability to reason intelligently about one of the most difficult and
sensitive topics in any society. By virtue of the variety of religious cultures studied, the training will deepen
students’ mutual understanding and sensitivity to prepare them to become truly responsible global citizens.
 
The department offers a major (31 credit hours), an Honors Program, a minor (18 credit hours) in religious studies, a
minor (20 credit hours) in Islamic studies, and a minor in Arabic language (18 credit hours). A student may pursue
both the minor in Islamic studies and the minor in Arabic language.
 
Program of Concentration in Religious Studies
31 credit hours. The program of concentration in religious studies seeks to introduce students to the rich diversity of
religious traditions in the world (Breadth component) and to build depth of study in areas of specific interest to the
student (Depth component). In addition, the curriculum includes instruction in the range of theories and methods
used to approach religious traditions academically (Tools of the Discipline component). The student will then be able
to pursue individual interests (electives).
 
A maximum of two courses (6 credit hours) outside of the department may count toward the major. Of these, one
course (3 credit hours) outside of the department may count toward the Depth Component. A foreign language
course approved as an elective is not subject to the two-course (6 credit hours) limit. No course may be used to
satisfy more than one of the four components of the major.
 
1. Breadth Component (9 credit hours)

COURSES OFFERED: SC
 
The College of Arts and Science and the School of Engineering offer an interdisciplinary minor in scientific computing
to help students in the physical, biological, and social sciences as well as engineering acquire the ever-increasing
computational skills that such careers demand. Students who complete this minor will have a toolkit that includes
programming skills useful for simulating physical, biological, and social dynamics as well as an understanding of
how to take advantage of modern software tools to extract meaningful information from small and large data sets.
 
Computation is now an integral part of modern science. Computer simulation allows the study of natural phenomena
impossible or intractable through experimental means. Astronomers studying the formation of massive black holes,
neuroscientists studying brain networks for human memory, economists studying effects of regulation on market
dynamics, and biochemists studying the three-dimensional structure of proteins are united in many of the
computational challenges they face and the tools and techniques they use to solve these challenges.
 
Students pursuing the scientific computing minor are taught techniques for understanding such complex physical,
biological, and social systems. Students are introduced to computational methods for simulating and analyzing
models of complex systems, to scientific visualization and data mining techniques needed to detect structure in
massively large multidimensional data sets, to high-performance computing techniques for simulating models on
computing clusters with hundreds or thousands of parallel, independent processors and for analyzing terabytes or
more of data that may be distributed across a massive cloud or grid storage environment.
 
The scientific computing minor at Vanderbilt is supported by faculty and includes students from a wide range of
scientific and engineering disciplines. While the content domain varies, these disciplines often require
similar computational approaches, high-performance computing resources, and skills to simulate interactions, model
real-life systems, and test competing hypotheses. Scientific computing embodies the computational tools and
techniques for solving many of the grand challenges facing science and engineering today.
 
The minor in scientific computing prepares students for advanced course work that combines computational  
approaches with a substantive area of science or engineering. It prepares students for directed or independent
study with a faculty member on a research project. It prepares students for advanced study in graduate school. It
provides skills that will be attractive to many employers after graduation.
 
The minor in scientific computing is distinct from the minor in computer science. Scientific computing uses
computation as a tool to solve scientific and engineering problems in research and application. It is more focused on
simulation, numerical techniques, high performance computing, and higher-level methods than the minor in
computer science, which is focused on the algorithms, systems, and technologies that enable such methods to be
developed and employed.
 
Details of the minor requirements are provided in the School of Engineering section of the catalog, and are also
available at vanderbilt.edu/scientific_computing.

COURSES OFFERED: SOC
 
Sociology, the study of social consensus, conflict, and change, offers students a rich and systematic understanding
of society and the meaning of social interaction. The department’s courses cover a wide range of sociological
themes including arts, culture, and religion; cities, states, and political economy; deviant behavior and crime;
environment and population; gender and sexuality; health and the life course; race, ethnicity, and immigration;
social movements, politics, and power; and work, labor, and occupations. Undergraduate courses in sociology
prepare students for graduate work or provide further preparation for a career in law, medicine, business, research,
education, the clergy, nursing, social work, or civil service. Two major programs are available, sociology and
environmental sociology. Students may declare only one of the majors offered by the Department of Sociology;
double majors within the department are not permitted.

COURSES OFFERED: CTLN, PORT, SPAN
 
The Department of Spanish and Portuguese offers a wide range of courses in the language, culture, and literature of
Spain and Spanish America and is well known for its program in Portuguese and Brazilian studies. Intensive
Elementary Catalan is also offered.
 
The department offers programs of concentration in both Spanish and Spanish and Portuguese. Majors take courses
in language, literature, linguistics, and culture. An interdisciplinary major is available in Spanish and European
Studies. Qualified Spanish majors may elect to take graduate courses in their senior year or participate in honors
work. Minors in Spanish and in Portuguese are also offered.
 
The department serves majors from the Center for Latin American Studies and the Max Kade Center for European
and German Studies. On the graduate level, the department offers a doctoral program in Spanish and a combination
doctoral degree in Spanish and Portuguese.
 
Many students participate in Vanderbilt programs in Seville, Barcelona, Madrid, and Palma de Mallorca in Spain;
Argentina, Chile, and Brazil in South America; and Cuba and the Dominican Republic in the Caribbean. Maymesters
in Spain and Peru are also offered. Activities organized by the department include lectures, films, symposia, and
Brazil Week. The department has a chapter of the national honor society Sigma Delta Pi for students of Spanish.
 
Note for all programs: An AP score of 5 on the Spanish literature test, with a proctored departmental placement
score of 460 or greater, may substitute for SPAN 3301W.  An AP score of 5 on the Spanish language test, with a
proctored departmental placement test of 460 or greater, may substitute for  Spanish 3302.  A student who earns
an AP score of 5 on both tests and receives a proctored departmental placement score of 460 or greater may choose
only one substitution.

COURSES OFFERED: THTR
 
Vanderbilt's Department of Theatre offers a vital center of innovative scholarship, teaching, creative expression, and
exploration. The study of theatre introduces students to a major form of literature and performing arts, thereby
developing a familiarity with one of the greatest cultural heritages and an understanding of human behavior and
civilization as it is reflected through the ages. Theatre uniquely shapes perceptions about life into an active
experience. Because this process encourages critical thought and discussion, the department provides a singular
and important aspect of a liberal arts education through its production season and course work. Viewed as a
practical extension of the department’s curriculum, plays are produced in Neely Auditorium, a laboratory where
students learn to form creative expressions as well as to evaluate and to critique them.
 
On one level, the Department of Theatre helps the general liberal arts student develop reasoned standards of
criticism and an understanding of the intimate correlation between the theatre and the society which it reflects,
preparing Vanderbilt graduates for successful careers in theatre as well as other fields of interest. For its majors and
minors, the department provides a more detailed and specialized study of the major components of theatrical
endeavor, allowing opportunities for the practical application of course work in the productions staged at the
theatre. In many cases, the department helps to prepare students with professional aspirations as either artists or
teachers in their specialized area of interest.
 
Work in the productions at Vanderbilt reflects the instruction that occurs in the classroom at Neely Auditorium.
Because the academic endeavors require hands-on, project-oriented teaching, students can expect small-to-
medium class enrollments and numerous opportunities for exposure to faculty instruction outside of the classroom.
The department’s curriculum includes courses in acting, directing, design, technology, dramatic literature, theatre
history and criticism, and playwriting. The Department of Theatre frequently offers a Maymester program of study of
theatre in London and the U.K. Students can either major or minor in theatre at Vanderbilt. The major consists of a
minimum of 35 credit hours that include courses in acting, directing, dramatic literature, theatre history/criticism,
design, technology, and stagecraft. For the minor, students select one of three more narrowly focused tracks
(dramatic literature/theatre history, acting/directing, or design/technology) and complete a minimum of 18 credit
hours of course work.
 
Students may also learn about theatre by studying with Coe Artists, distinguished guest-artist professionals brought
to campus each year to benefit majors, minors, and those with a serious interest in theatre. Weeklong master
classes are taught by playwrights, actors, designers, and directors from the professional world of theatre, television,
and film. Previous Coe Artists have included such celebrated artists as Tim Miller, Sojourn Theatre, Katie Pearl, Lisa
D’Amour, and Shawn Hall. Theatre also brings professional directors and designers as Coe Artists to campus to work
within the department's production season.

Students have the opportunity to participate in a variety of theatrical experiences working with professional guests,
as well as hear professional artists speak as guest lecturers.
 
Theatre majors and minors from Vanderbilt have entered a wide variety of professions and post-graduate
opportunities after they graduate. Those seeking employment in the fields of theatre, film, radio, or television have
secured positions at appropriate graduate schools or internships with professional companies immediately following
their study at Vanderbilt. Many distinguished professional theatre companies across the nation, television networks
in New York, and the film industry in Los Angeles include Vanderbilt University Theatre alumni as writers, actors,
designers, technicians, dramaturgs, and stage managers. In addition, many Vanderbilt theatre students have
secured teaching assignments at either the college/university level (once they have completed appropriate post-
graduate education) or the elementary/secondary education level. Theatre also prepares students for success in
other professions including medicine, law, education, policy, engineering, and business to name a few.
 
The study and practice of theatre offers individuals opportunities to participate through a variety of means: to
collaborate with all other members of a production team; to express elements of abstract thought in both oral and
written form; and to develop the critical ability to assess and analyze aesthetic choices.
 
 
Program of Concentration in Theatre

Accommodations for Students with Disabilities
Student Access provides accommodations to students with disability-related limitations. Common
accommodations include, but are not limited to, extended time for testing, assistance with locating sign
language interpreters, audio textbooks, physical adaptations, supplemental notes, and reading services.
Students may also request accommodations related to housing, dining, and transportation. Accommodations are
determined on an individual, case-by-case basis. Specific concerns pertaining to student accommodations or
access on campus should be directed to the Office for Student Access (studentaccess@vanderbilt.edu) or by
calling (615) 343-9727. For additional information please visit the Student Access website:
vanderbilt.edu/student-access.
Nondiscrimination, Anti-Harassment, Anti-Retaliation, and Sexual Misconduct
The Title IX Office (vanderbilt.edu/title-ix) and/or the Equal Opportunity and Access Office ( vanderbilt.edu/eoa)
investigate allegations of prohibited discrimination, harassment, and retaliation involving members of the
Vanderbilt community. This includes allegations of sexual misconduct and other forms of power-based personal
violence.
If you believe that a member of the Vanderbilt community has engaged in prohibited discrimination, harassment,
or retaliation, based on a protected identity other than sex please contact the Equal Opportunity and Access
Office. If the offense is criminal in nature, you may file a report with Vanderbilt University Police Department.
The Title IX Office also facilitates the provision of supportive measures and other accommodations for students
affected by sexual misconduct and power-based personal violence. Some examples of these supportive
measures are mutual no contact directives, adjusted course schedules, and housing adjustments.
Specific concerns pertaining to prohibited discrimination, harassment, or retaliation should be directed to the
Equal Opportunity and Access Office at (615) 343-9336. Allegations of sex discrimination, sexual misconduct and
other forms of power-based personal violence, should be directed to the Title IX Office at (615) 343-9004.
Official University Communications
Certain federal statutes require that information be delivered to each student. Vanderbilt delivers much of this
information via email. Official electronic notifications, including those required by statutes, those required by
university policy, and instructions from university officials, will be sent to students’ Vanderbilt email addresses:
user.name@vanderbilt.edu. Students are required to be familiar with the contents of official university
notifications, and to respond to instructions and other official correspondence requiring a response. Some
messages will include links to the YES Message Center, which is a secure channel for official communication of a
confidential nature. However, students should not wait to receive such a message, and should check YES
frequently to remain current on official, confidential communications.
The university makes every effort to avoid inundating students with nonessential email (often called “spam”),
and maintains separate lists from which students may unsubscribe for announcements of general interest.
Directory information should be kept current. Students may report address changes, emergency contact
information, and missing person contact information via the web by logging in to YES (Your Enrollment Services)
https://yes.vanderbilt.edu and clicking on the Personal Information link.
Student Records (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act)
Page 478 of 1019 

Vanderbilt University is subject to the provisions of federal law known as the Family Educational Rights and
Privacy Act (also referred to as FERPA). This act affords matriculated students certain rights with respect to their
educational records. These rights include:
1. The right to inspect and review their education records within 45 days of the day the University receives a
request for access. Students should submit to the Office of the University Registrar written requests that
identify the record(s) they wish to inspect. The Office of the University Registrar will make arrangements
for access and notify the student of the time and place where the records may be inspected. If the Office
of the University Registrar does not maintain the records, the student will be directed to the University
official to whom the request should be addressed.
2. The right to request the amendment of any part of their education records that a student believes is
inaccurate or misleading. Students who wish to request an amendment to their educational record should
write the University official responsible for the record, clearly identify the part of the record they want
changed, and specify why it is inaccurate or misleading. If the University decides not to amend the record
as requested by the student, the student will be notified of the decision and advised of his or her right to a
hearing.
3. The right to consent to disclosures of personally identifiable information contained in the student’s
education records to third parties, except in situations that FERPA allows disclosure without the student’s
consent. These exceptions include:
Disclosure to school officials with legitimate educational interests. A “school official” is a person
employed by the University in an administrative, supervisory, academic or research, or support-
staff position (including University law enforcement personnel and health staff); contractors,
consultants, and other outside service providers with whom the University has contracted; a
member of the Board of Trust; or a student serving on an official University committee, such as the
Honor Council, Student Conduct Council, or a grievance committee, or assisting another school
official in performing his or her tasks. A school official has a legitimate educational interest if the
official needs to review an education record in order to fulfill his or her professional responsibility.
Disclosure to parents if the student is a dependent for tax purposes
Disclosure to appropriate individuals (e.g., parents/guardians, spouses, housing staff, health care
personnel, police, etc.) where disclosure is in connection with a health or safety emergency and
knowledge of such information is necessary to protect the health or safety of the student or other
individuals.
Disclosure to a parent or legal guardian of a student, information regarding the student’s violation
of any federal, state, or local law, or of any rule or policy of the institution, governing the use or
possession of alcohol or a controlled substance if the University has determined that the student
has committed a disciplinary violation with respect to the use or possession and the student is
under the age of 21 at the time of the disclosure to the parent/guardian.
Disclosure to various authorized representatives of government entities (such as, compliance with
Student and Exchange Visitors Information System [SEVIS], Solomon Amendment, etc.).
FERPA provides the university the ability to designate certain student information as “directory information.”
Directory information may be made available to any person without the student’s consent unless the student
gives notice as provided for, below. Vanderbilt has designated the following as directory information: the
student’s name, address, telephone number, email address, student ID photos, major field of study, school,
classification, participation in officially recognized activities and sports, weights and heights of members of
athletic teams, dates of attendance, degrees and awards received, the most recent previous educational agency
or institution attended by the student, and other information that would not generally be considered harmful or
an invasion of privacy if disclosed. Any student who does not wish disclosure of directory information should
notify the Office of the University Registrar in writing. No element of directory information as defined above is
released for students who request nondisclosure except as required by statute.
The request for nondisclosure does not apply to class rosters in online class management applications, or to
residential rosters—or rosters of groups a student may join voluntarily—in online, co-curricular engagement
applications, or rosters of other information on the websites of student organizations that a student may join.
Neither class rosters in online class management applications, nor residential rosters in online co-curricular
engagement applications, are available to the public.
As of January 3, 2012, the U.S. Department of Education’s FERPA regulations expand the circumstances under
which students’ education records and personally identifiable information (PII) contained in such records—
including Social Security Numbers, grades, or other private information—may be accessed without consent. First,
the U.S. Comptroller General, the U.S. Attorney General, the U.S. Secretary of Education, or state and local
Page 479 of 1019 

education authorities (“Federal and State Authorities”) may allow access to student records and PII without
consent to any third party designated by a Federal or State Authority to evaluate a federal- or state-supported
education program. The evaluation may relate to any program that is “principally engaged in the provision of
education,” such as early childhood education and job training, as well as any program that is administered by an
education agency or institution.
Second, Federal and State Authorities may allow access to education records and PII without consent, to
researchers performing certain types of studies, in certain cases even when the University objects to or does not
request such research. Federal and State Authorities must obtain certain use-restriction and data security
promises from the third parties that they authorize to receive PII, but the Authorities need not maintain direct
control over the third parties.
In addition, in connection with Statewide Longitudinal Data Systems, State Authorities may collect, compile,
permanently retain, and share without student consent, PII from education records, and may track student
participation in education and other programs by linking such PII to other personal information that they obtain
from other Federal or State data sources, including workforce development, unemployment insurance, child
welfare, juvenile justice, military service, and migrant student records systems.
If a student believes the university has failed to comply with FERPA, he or she may file a complaint using the
Student Complaint and Grievance Procedures as outlined in the Student Handbook. If dissatisfied with the
outcome of this procedure, students may file a written complaint with the Family Policy Compliance Office, U.S.
Department of Education, 400 Maryland Avenue SW, Washington, DC 20202-5920.
Questions about the application of the provisions of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act should be
directed to the Office of the University Registrar or to the Office of General Counsel.
The Vanderbilt Honor Code and the Honor System
Vanderbilt University takes pride in its honor code and its student-run honor system.
The statement of the honor code is shared by all ten schools of the university:
Vanderbilt University students pursue all academic endeavors with integrity. They conduct themselves
honorably, professionally, and respectfully in all realms of their studies in order to promote and secure an
atmosphere of dignity and trust. The keystone of our honor system is self-regulation, which requires cooperation
and support from each member of the University community.
The Honor System is a time-honored tradition that began with the first classes at Vanderbilt in 1875. Students
established the system and continue to manage it today. It rests on the presumption that all work submitted as
part of course requirements is produced by the student, without help from any other source unless
acknowledgement is given in a manner prescribed by the instructor. Cheating, plagiarizing, or otherwise
falsifying results of study are specifically prohibited. The system applies not only to examinations but also to
written work and computer programs submitted to instructors. Detailed descriptions of Honor System violations
and Undergraduate Honor Council procedures are published in the Student Handbook, available on the web at
vanderbilt.edu/student_handbook.
Responsibility for the preservation of the system falls on the individual student who, by registration,
acknowledges the authority of the Undergraduate Honor Council. Students are expected to demand of
themselves and their fellow students complete respect for the Honor Code. Ignorance of the regulations is not a
defense for abuse of regulations. All incoming students attend a mandatory signing ceremony and educational
program on the Honor System at the beginning of the fall semester. Additional information about the Honor
Page 480 of 1019 

System is available on the web at studentorg.vanderbilt.edu/honorcouncil/.
VA Compliance Statement
Any covered individual will be able to attend or participate in the course of education during the period beginning
on the date on which the individual provides to the educational institution a certificate of eligibility for
entitlement to educational assistance under chapter 31 or 33 (a “certificate of eligibility” can also include a
“Statement of Benefits” obtained from the Department of Veterans Affairs’ (VA) website – eBenefits, or a VAF 28-
1905 form for chapter 31 authorization purposes) and ending on the earlier of the following dates:
1. The date on which payment from VA is made to the institution.
2. 90 days after the date the institution certified tuition and fees following the receipt of the certificate of
eligibility.
Vanderbilt University will not impose any penalty, including the assessment of late fees, the denial of access to
classes, libraries, or other institutional facilities, or the requirement that a covered individual borrow additional
funds, on any covered individual because of the individual’s inability to meet his or her financial obligations to
the institution due to the delayed disbursement funding from VA under chapter 31 or 33.

The University
Commodore Cornelius Vanderbilt, who gave a million dollars to build and endow Vanderbilt University in 1873,
expressed the wish that it “contribute . . . to strengthening the ties which should exist between all geographical
sections of our common country.”
A little more than a hundred years later, the Vanderbilt Board of Trust adopted the following mission statement:
“We reaffirm our belief in the unique and special contributions that Vanderbilt can make toward meeting the
nation’s requirements for scholarly teaching, training, investigation, and service, and we reaffirm our conviction
that to fulfill its inherited responsibilities, Vanderbilt must relentlessly pursue a lasting future and seek highest
quality in its educational undertakings.”
Today as Vanderbilt pursues its mission, the university more than fulfills the Commodore’s hope. It is one of a few
independent universities with both a quality undergraduate program and a full range of graduate and
professional programs. It has a strong faculty of more than 4,200 full-time members and a diverse student body
of more than 12,800.
The 334-acre campus is about one and one-half miles from the downtown business district of the city of Nashville,
combining the advantages of an urban location with a peaceful, parklike setting of broad lawns, shaded paths,
and quiet plazas.

College of Arts and Science. Bachelor of Arts.
Blair School of Music. Bachelor of Music, Bachelor of Musical Arts.
