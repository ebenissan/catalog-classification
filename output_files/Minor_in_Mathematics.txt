2. Linear algebra and differential equations as in Program I.3. At least 21 additional credit hours of advanced course work,a. including four courses taken from the following three categories, at least one from each category:1. Algebra: 3300, 4300, 4301.2. Analysis: 3100, 3110, 6100, 6101.3. Topology and Geometry: 3200, 3230, 4200, 4201, 4220, 6210.4. The remainder of the 21 credit hours must be chosen from 2800 or above, excluding 4999.4. The remainder of the credit hours must be chosen from 2800 or above.Students who complete Program III and, in addition, fulfill the Honors requirements listed below, will graduate withdepartmental honors. Students planning to teach in secondary school should contact the director of secondary education programs in theDepartment of Teaching and Learning at Peabody College for course recommendations. Honors ProgramThe Honors Program in Mathematics is designed to afford superior students the opportunity to pursue moreintensive work within their major field. The program requires:1. Completion of all the requirements of Program III (Honors Track).2. Graduate with a minimum grade point average of 3.6 in courses that count toward the mathematics3. Completion of a senior thesis, typically in the second semester of the senior year. With approval of thedirector of undergraduate studies, the thesis may be based on research initiated or completed at anotheracademic institution, such as during a summer REU4. Oral examination on the senior thesis. A committee of at least three faculty members—at least two from theDepartment of Mathematics, one being the thesis adviser—shall evaluate the thesis and the oral examination.Exceptional achievement on the thesis will earn highestInterested students may apply to the director of undergraduate studies for admission to the Honors Program in theirjunior year or the first semester of their senior year. Applicants must meet college requirements for entry to theHonors Program and must maintain a minimum grade point average of 3.6 in courses that count toward themathematics major. The application includes a one- to two-page proposal of the planned thesis and the signature of the faculty memberwho will be the thesis adviser.The thesis must be submitted no later than two weeks before the end of classes in the semester of graduation. Theoral examination will take place by the last day of classes in the semester of graduation. Highest honors will beawarded for a thesis that contains original high-quality research results in combination with an oral defense at thehighest quality level. Students may sign up for Math 4999 during one semester of their senior year. Math 4999 will not count toward the21 credit hours requirement in Program III. Please consult the director of undergraduate studies for details. Minor in MathematicsThe minor in mathematics requires at least 15 credit hours in mathematics, including:1. Completion of a calculus sequence: 2300, 2310, or 2500–2501.2. Linear algebra and differential equations: as in the Program II major.Page 421 of 1019
