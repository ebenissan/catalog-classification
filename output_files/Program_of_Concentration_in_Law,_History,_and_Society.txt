4980 but does not take 4981 may be considered to have fulfilled the capstone requirement for the major. 4. Electives (6–12 credit hours, depending on the nature of the capstone course) Program of Concentration in Law, History, and SocietyAs a human institution self-consciously aware of its past, “The Law” raises a complex set of issues that can beaddressed historically. Legislation and jurisprudence, for example, allow historians a privileged perspective into howsocieties sought to define themselves, their values, and their membership. Constitutions provide maps of politicalpower, and serve as sites of struggle over goods both real and symbolic. Records of legal practice are often wellpreserved, allowing access to the voices and actions of people who are usually left out of systems of politicalorganization. This major approaches law from both a historical and an interdisciplinary perspective. Emphasis will be placed onclose reading of legal documents, research in legal archives, and analytical writing. Students will be encouraged todevelop reading programs and research topics that stretch across national and chronological boundaries, and tothink comparatively. Students may not major both in history and in law, history, and society. Students majoring inlaw, history, and society may apply to receive honors through the History Honors Program. The major program requires a minimum of 30 credit hours in history; no more than 3 credit hours of AP or IB creditmay count toward this total.
