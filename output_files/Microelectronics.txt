Engineering CommunicationsFACULTY POINT OF CONTACT Yiorgos Kostoulas Communication is an essential skill for every career path. In this collection of courses, students will learn how tocommunicate within and outside their fields and within project teams and organizations. Students must take these three courses (9 credit hours):ES 2100W – Technical CommunicationsENGM 2440 – Applied Behavioral ScienceENGM 3350 – Organizational BehaviorHuman Computer Interaction (HCI)FACULTY POINT OF CONTACT Graham Hemingway HCI is valuable for creating technology that is not only functional but also user-friendly, accessible, and aligned withthe diverse needs of users. This approach contributes to the success and sustainability of technological products andsystems in a rapidly evolving digital landscape. Students who study HCI are well equipped for careers in userexperience (UX) design, usability engineering, accessibility, product design and augmented and virtual reality. Students must take at least three courses and 9 credit hours from:CS 3258 – Introduction to Computer GraphicsCS 4376 – Foundations of Human Computer InteractionCS 4275 – Error Analysis in Safety Critical SystemsCS 4247 – Data VisualizationCS 4249 – Projects in Virtual Reality DesignSpecial Topics if specified in the Class Note on YES.MicroelectronicsFACULTY POINT OF CONTACT W.
