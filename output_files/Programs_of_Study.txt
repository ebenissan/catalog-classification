Combined B.A./M.A. (4+1) ProgramThe College of Arts and Science offers students in many departments and programs the opportunity to earn both thebachelor’s degree and the master’s degree in a shorter period of time and at less cost than is normally the case. Exceptional students in the College of Arts and Science can obtain both degrees in an expedited period, typicallywithin, but not less than, five years.The usual period of study for both the bachelor’s and the master’s degree is six years. Through the 4+1 option, thestudent and her or his adviser plan a five-year program of study. It is important to note that there is no provision forobtaining both degrees in a period shorter than five years. The program is intended for selected students for whomthe master’s degree is sufficient preparation for their career goals, is desirable as a goal in itself, or is viewed asadditional preparation before pursuing a doctorate or a professional degree. The areas of study available for the Combined B.A./M.A. (4+1) option within Arts and Science are determined byindividual departments and programs, which also determine the policies and guidelines to be followed. Students willbe admitted to the Combined B.A./M.A. program only by the invitation and the approval of the department orprogram. Programs of StudyPage 118 of 1019
