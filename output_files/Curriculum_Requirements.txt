ADJUNCT INSTRUCTORS David Livingston, Keith Loiseau, Heather Smith, Bryan Tharpe, Hannah Walter, Adrian Ward,Scott Potter, Minh Nghiem,LECTURER Phillip Collins B.E. in environmental engineering. The curriculum includes analysis and design courses in environmentalengineering. Vanderbiltâ€™s B.E. in environmental engineering prepares students for entry-level positions in manyspecialty areas of environmental engineering, as well as a variety of other careers, such as business, government,and law. The major will provide students with the tools necessary to develop effective solutions to solve emergingand existing issues such as water resources, quality, and treatment; aging infrastructures; climate change andcarbon neutral innovations; energy and material resources; wastes and pollution; and other environmentalchallenges. Recognizing that environmental solutions cannot be realized without consideration of social, cultural,economic, and political factors, students will be required to extend the breadth of their studies with courses in datascience and global perspectives courses in social sciences, economics, political sciences, and the humanities.  Thesewill be in addition to foundational courses in the basic and applied sciences, mathematics, engineering, andadvanced courses in fate, transport, and treatment of contaminants in the environment. The curriculum culminateswith a senior design project in which students will have the opportunity to draw on and integrate the broadknowledge they have gained from the data science and global perspectives courses with the science andengineering knowledge they gained in the major. Due to the complex interdisciplinary nature of the field, manyundergraduate students continue their environmental engineering education and earn either a professional (MEng)degree or a graduate (MS or PhD) degree.  Undergraduate Honors Program. The Honors Program in environmental engineering provides an opportunity forselected students to develop individually through independent study and research. The environmental engineeringhonors program requires a minimum overall GPA of 3.5. Acceptance to the program is made by petition to thefaculty during the junior year. Transfer students may be considered for admission after completing one semester atVanderbilt. Candidates for honors choose their technical courses with the consent of a faculty honors adviser. Athree-credit hour independent study course and a summer research internship with a final report and presentationgiven in the spring semester of the senior year to the ENVE faculty and students are required. The independentstudy course may also be counted towards the environmental engineering technical electives. The diplomadesignation is Honors in Environmental Engineering. Facilities: The environmental laboratories are fully supplied with modern instrumentation for chemical, physical,biological, and radiological analysis of soils, sediments, water, wastewater, air, and solid waste. They includeequipment for the study of biological waste treatment, physical-chemical waste treatment, contaminant masstransfer, and state-of-the-art instrumentation.   All are available for student use in courses, demonstrations, andresearch.  Undergraduates in environmental engineering may apply the pass/fail option only to courses taken as open orliberal arts core electives, subject to the school requirements for pass/fail. A double major in Environmental Engineering and Chemical Engineering is offered as a unitary ChE-ENVE curriculum,which is described in the Chemical Engineering section of the catalog under its curriculum requirements. It requiresa minimum of 137 semester hours. Undergraduates in the double major may apply the pass/fail option only tocourses taken as open electives, subject to the school requirements for pass/fail.Curriculum requirementsThe B.E. in environmental engineering will require a minimum of 121 hours, distributed as follows:1.
