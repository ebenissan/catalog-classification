The future health and well-being of humanityhinge in large part on smart production and use of energy, water, and related resources, as these are centraldeterminants of climate change, habitable space, and human and ecological health. This program examines therelationships among individual, institutional, and societal choices for energy production and use, and the impactsand benefits of these choices on the environment and health through climate, water quality, and natural resources.It requires a total of 15 semester hours of course work, some of which may be taken as electives associated with thestudentâ€™s major program. Five courses are required: two core courses and three elective courses taken from at least2 areas: Area I: Energy Systems, Area II: Environmental Engineering, and Area III: Environmental Survey.
