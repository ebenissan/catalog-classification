The Department of History of Art and Architecture offers a major and minor in history of art, and a major and minorin architecture and the built environment.Program of Concentration in History of ArtThe history of art major requires 30 credit hours and gives students the opportunity to study art and visual cultureacross a wide range of historical periods, from ancient to contemporary. The program is designed to allow forconcentration in particular periods and areas of interest. By requiring courses in both the lecture and seminarformat, the program aims to provide a basis of comprehensive knowledge and challenging opportunities for morespecialized instruction. Students should consider related offerings in cognate disciplines in the humanities and social sciences. Thoseplanning graduate work in history of art should pursue advanced studies—which may include honors—and takeadvanced courses in other departments offering complementary course work. Advanced language studies arestrongly recommended, as graduate programs expect reading facility in one language for the M.A. and two for thePh.D., with French and German the most commonly required. Non-European languages should be considered forthose primarily interested in global traditions. Course work is distributed as follows:A 1000-level course (3 credit hours): Students must complete one 1000-level survey course in history of artor architecture selected from HART 1100, 1105, 1120, 1121, 1122, 1200, 1205, 1220, 1300, or 1400. Thiscourse is not a prerequisite for further history of art course work but must be taken at Vanderbilt; AP creditwill not be accepted.Area requirements (15 credit hours)—five history of art courses at the 2000 level or above, one each from thefollowing areas:a. Ancient: HART 2200, 2210, 2220, 2230, 2250, 2260, 3224, 3226, 3228W, 3240W, 3252, 3256W; CLAS2250, 3200, 3700, 3710, 3720, 3730b. Medieval: HART 2270, 2275, 2285, 2288, 2290, 3364Wc. Renaissance/Baroque: HART 2310, 2320W, 2325, 2330, 2362, 2390, 3320, 3320W, 3332, 3334, 3334Wd. Modern: HART 2600, 2620, 2622, 2625, 2650, 2660, 2662, 2665, 2710, 2720, 2722, 2740, 2750, 2755,2760, 2765, 2772, 3605W, 3712W, 3718W, 3725W, 3735, 3740, 3757W, 3765W, 3766W, 3767We. Global: HART 2100, 2110, 2120, 2130, 2150, 2151, 2160, 2165, 2170, 2175, 2180, 2192, 3112, 3140,3164W, 3173W, 3174Electives (6 credit hours)—two upper-level courses in history of art (HART 2100 to 3850 and 3890; CLAS 2250,3200, 3700, 3710, 3720, 3730) in addition to the area requirements.Advanced Seminars (6 credit hours)— any HART 3000-level writing class, 4960Program of Concentration in Architecture and the Built EnvironmentThe track in architecture and the built environment requires 30 credit hours and promotes interdisciplinary andtrans-institutional study. It enables students to develop breadth and expertise in the history and theory ofarchitecture, landscape architecture, and constructed environments; design studies; and theoretical and historicalapproaches to analyzing urban scale and city planning. Students can build a foundation for graduate work in thesefields as well as for spatially related specializations in cognate disciplines such as anthropology, political science,public policy, sociology, demography, public health, environmental studies, civil engineering, computer science, andgeography and geographic information systems. Course work is distributed as follows:1. A 1000-level course (3 credit hours): Students must complete one 1000-level survey course in history of artor architecture selected from HART 1100, 1105, 1120, 1121, 1122, 1200, 1205, 1210W, 1220, 1300, 1330W,1400, 1740W, or CLAS 1020. This course is not a prerequisite for further history of art course work but mustbe taken at Vanderbilt; AP credit will not be accepted.2. Three courses (9 credit hours) in architectural, design, landscape, or urban history selected from HART 2100,2110, 2120, 2130, 2150, 2151, 2160, 2175, 2180, 2200, 2210, 2220, 2225, 2230, 2250, 2270, 2275, 2285,2290, 2325, 2330, 2650, 2662, 2665, 2720, 2722, 2740, 2780, 2782, 2815, 2820, 3112, 3140, 3174, 3252,3790; and CLAS 2250, 3200.3. One advanced seminar in architectural history (3 credit hours) selected from HART 3164W, 3240W, 3256W,Page 402 of 1019 
3725W, 3757W, 3765W, 3766W, 3825W or 3810W (when the course topic concerns architecture and the builtenvironment, landscape architecture, design studies, or urban planning).4. Five electives (15 credit hours): Electives may include any HART courses listed above in major requirements1-3 not used to satisfy any of those requirements, or courses chosen from the list below. A maximum of twoelectives may be taken from any one department (with the exception of History of Art and Architecture), anda maximum of two electives may be taken at the 1000 level.Students will work with the Director of Undergraduate Studies and departmental advisers to design a program ofstudy that addresses their academic interests and career goals. Students interested in graduate programs inarchitecture and design should review elective selections with the pre-architecture adviser.
