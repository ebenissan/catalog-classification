Undergraduate DegreesThe First YearMost courses normally scheduled for the first year are common to both the B.E. and B.S. degree programs. While thecurriculum for the first year is generally the same for all students, there are important variations. For example, somemajor programs require a full year of introductory chemistry; others do not. Students should become familiar withrequirements of those programs in which they have an interest and confer with their adviser at the time ofenrollment and throughout the first year to plan a program of study that will keep options open as long as possible. Specimen curricula for the engineering programs are given in the Courses of Study section. Requirements for theB.E. and B.S. degrees for the various programs vary in the minimum amount of hours and in specific courserequirements in the basic sciences and in mathematics. Included in the first year for all majors is the course Engineering Science 1401â€“1403 Introduction to Engineering,which introduces the student to design tools used in all areas of engineering.Mathematics and PhysicsEntering engineering students will be placed in the appropriate level mathematics course. Students having one fullyear or more of high school credit in analytic geometry and calculus may qualify for advanced placement in aregular sequence by scoring well on the Advanced Placement Examination. Students with high mathematical ability and achievement as demonstrated by testing credit or credit byexamination through the Department of Mathematics may begin in the next mathematics course for which theyqualify (e.g., MATH 1301 or 2300). For more information, see the testing credit information under Advanced Credit inthe Admissions section of this catalog and course descriptions under Mathematics in the Arts and Science section ofthis catalog. For majors requiring Math 2420 (Methods of Ordinary Differential Equations), students may select Math2400 (Differential Equations with Linear Algebra) or Math 2610 (Ordinary Differential Equations) as a substitute. First-year students with a test score of 5 on the Calculus-BC Advanced Placement examination and who wish topursue the honors track of a second major in mathematics may take MATH 2500-2501, which will cover the materialfrom MATH 2300 and 2600 but in a deeper and integrated fashion. Note that while linear algebra is required forsome VUSE majors, no VUSE major specifically requires 2600. Students considering this option must discuss thiswith the Director of Undergraduate Studies in Mathematics and the School of Engineering Office of AcademicServices. Students with inadequate backgrounds in mathematics may be required to take Math 1005 (Pre-calculusMathematics). Taking this course constitutes an additional requirement for graduation. Math 1010-1011 (Probability and Statistical Inference) and Math 1100 (Survey of Calculus) cannot be creditedtoward a degree in the School of Engineering. Students with greater interest in physics may enroll in Phys 1911, 1912, 1912L, and 2255L (Principles of Physics Iand II and labs) as substitutes for Phys 1601, 1602, 1601L, and 1602L (General Physics I and II and labs),respectively. Students should consult with their Academic Adviser before taking this more advanced Physicssequence. Pre-calculus courses Phys 1010, 1010L, 1020, 1020L, 2051, 2052, 2053, and 2054 cannot be credited toward adegree in the School of Engineering.Page 175 of 1019
