Focusareas are typically nine credit hours, and qualifying courses are listed in the catalog. Students can declare amaximum of three focus areas; however, a qualifying course cannot be applied to more than one focus area.Students interested in declaring a focus area must do so before the start of their final semester at Vanderbilt.Successful completion of a declared focus area will be designated on a studentâ€™s transcript upon graduation.
