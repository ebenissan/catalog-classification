The fourth part of the major defines a focus for the student through both experiential and seminar-style EES courses.The fifth component addresses science communication skills with one course.  The sixth component of the major is a1 credit hour seminar that serves as a capstone for senior students. In addition to the major, qualified Track 1students may elect to participate in the Honors Program designed for highly motivated students who want to pursueresearch as undergraduates. Opportunities for research may be available to other students outside of the HonorsProgram. At least 36 credit hours toward the major are required as follows: 1. EES Foundations (3+1 credit hours each): Two introductory courses, one with lab, from1510/1510L, 1030/1030L, and/or 1081/1081L72. EES Core (4 credit hours): 2510, Required as prerequisite for nearly all upper level EES courses43. STEM Foundation (3 credit hours each): One course in scientific computing: CS 1101 or DS 1101One course in statistics: MATH 1011, DS 2100, BSCI 3270, ECON 1500 or 1510, MATH 218,2820, or 2821, SOC 2100One additional supporting science: any additional course from ASTR, BSCI, CHEM, MATH,PHYS, CS, DS excluding courses numbered 1111 and excluding BSCI 1400. Other courses fromthe School of Engineering may be considered with permission of the DUS94. EES Focus (1-4 credit hours each):At least five classes and at least 15 hours, chosen from any EES course numbered 2050 orabove 3000. Must include at least two courses at the 4000 level. At least eight hours in thiscategory must be experiential, from the following: lab courses (EES 3220, 3260, 3280, 3310,3330, 3340), field-based courses (EES 3865 [3-4 credit hours or 1 credit hour attached toanother regular EES course with permission]), EES 3875, or an include up to three credit hoursof research or internships (EES 3841, 3842, 3881, 4998, 4999)15-175. Earth Science Communication (0-3 credit hours): Any CSET course, any writing-intensive(W) course from EES, BSCI, CHEM, PHYS, or one course from the following: EES 3875, 4233,4680, 4996+4997, SCED 23300-36. Senior Seminar: 49611  Total hours:36-41Track 2This track is designed to prepare students for careers as earth and environmental scientists, including entering thescience workforce after graduation and/or pursuing postgraduate academic work. Given the broad and interdisciplinary nature of EES, it is important that students design an academic plan inconsultation with their adviser and referencing the EES Disciplinary Pathway documents, to ensure appropriatepreparation for their area of interest. Preparing to be competitive for graduate programs may include additionalcoursework beyond the major requirements, particularly advanced math, computing, chemistry, biosciences, orphysics, depending on disciplinary interest. Students on this pathway are encouraged to pursue researchparticularly if aimed at post-graduate academic work. Note that prerequisite STEM courses (CHEM 1601, PHYS 1501/1601, MATH 1100/1201/1301) may be taken on anungraded basis for students above the freshman level, but working knowledge of the course content will be requiredPage 360 of 1019 
in upper-level EES and other STEM courses. Students who are interested in pursuing minor and/or double majors in other STEM fields should discuss optionswith the DUS as some coursework in other departments may replace EES coursework if part of an intentionallydesigned plan made in consultation with the adviser and DUS. Track 2 is organized into six parts, beginning with one of three introductory courses that serve as an entry point. Thesecond part involves three core courses that provide all Track 2 majors with a common background in methods andways of thinking in Earth and environmental sciences. At least one EES core course must be completed beforestudents may enroll in more advanced focus courses of part four. Specific core courses may be prerequisite forrelated upper-level electives, and so students are encouraged to take these early in their academic career. As Earthand Environmental sciences employ techniques and foundational knowledge from all other STEM fields, courses inpart 2 and part 4 of the major have outside STEM courses as prerequisites and part 3 of the major rquires students tobuild additional skills in supporting STEM fields through two more STEM electives: one of which must be quantitativeor computational. The fourth part of the major defines a focus for the student through both experiential and seminar-style EES courses.The fifth component addresses science communication skills with one course.  The sixth component of the major is a1 credit hour seminar that serves as a capstone for senior students. Track 2 students are strongly encouraged topursue research. Highly motivated and successful students may elect to participate in the EES Honors Program. At least 37 credit hours toward the major are required as follows: 1. EES Foundations (3+1 credit hours each): One introductory course with lab, from1510/1510L, 1030/1030L, and/or 1081/1081L42. EES Core (4 credit hours): 2510, 2550, and one course in physical dynamics from thefollowing list: EES 2580, 4420, 4550, 4650. Note that all EES physical-dynamic focusedcourses have MATH 110/1201/1301 and PHYS 1501/1601/1911 as prerequisite and that CHEM1601 is corequisite for EES 2550.Required as prerequisite for nearly all upper level EES courses113. STEM Electives (3 credit hours each): Two courses from the following: CHEM 1602 or higher; PHYS 1502/1602, 1912 or higher, MATH2300 or higher, BSCI 1510 or higher, ASTR 2110 or higher, CS 1101 or higher, DS 1101 orhigher. One of these must be quantitative or computational, e.g. from MATH, CS, DS, or introstatistics (BSCI 3270).Other courses from the School of Engineering may be considered with permission of the DUS64.
