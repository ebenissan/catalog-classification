The minor is administered by the School of Engineering. Nanoscience and nanotechnology are based on the ability to synthesize, organize, characterize, and manipulatematter systematically at dimensions of ~1 to 100 nm, creating uniquely functional materials that differ in propertiesfrom those prepared by traditional approaches. At these length scales, materials can take on new properties thatcan be exploited in a wide range of applications such as for solar energy conversion, ultra-sensitive sensing, andnew types of vaccines. These activities require the integration of expertise from various areas of science andengineering, often relying on methods of synthesis, fabrication, and characterization that are beyond thosePage 435 of 1019
