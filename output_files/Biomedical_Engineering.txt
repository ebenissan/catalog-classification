Lewis, Marlon Thomas COURSES OFFERED: BME The foundations of biomedical engineering are the same as those in other engineering disciplines: mathematics,physics, chemistry, and engineering principles. Biomedical engineering builds on these foundations to solveproblems in biology  and medicine over the widest range of scales-from the nanoscale and molecular levels to thewhole body. Biomedical engineering provides a robust platform for employment in the medical device andinstrumentation industries as well as careers in companies that specialize in the development and application ofbiologics, biomaterials, computation, implants and processes. Our graduates gain entry into nationally recognizedgraduate schools for continuing studies in biomedical engineering. Biomedical engineering is also a rigorous path for admission to and success in medical school for those studentswilling and able to excel in mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, physiology, and engineering. The Department of Biomedical Engineering at Vanderbilt is unique among biomedical engineering programs in itsimmediate proximity to the world class Vanderbilt Medical Center, located on our compact campus. Our School ofMedicine is among the top ten in funding from the National Institutes of Health and includes a National CancerInstitute- recognized Comprehensive Cancer Center, a major children’s hospital and a Level I trauma center. Thisproximity and the strong relationships among faculty across multiple schools stimulate high impact research andprovide unique educational and research opportunities for students. Degree Programs. The Department of Biomedical Engineering offers courses of study leading to the B.E., M.S.,M.Eng., and Ph.D. Vanderbilt biomedical engineering is a well-established program with undergraduate degreesgranted continuously since 1965. Our undergraduate curriculum undergoes regular review and revision to ensurerelevancy and to maintain full ABET accreditation. Students have complete flexibility in the selection of biomedicalengineering, technical, and open electives. This allows students to design their own focus areas such asregenerative medicine and tissue engineering, wearables and point-of-care diagnostics, global health, surgery andengineering, robotics and prosthetics, lasers and medicine, medical imaging, biotechnology and nanomedicine,medical technology and entrepreneurship. Facilities. The Department of Biomedical Engineering is located in Stevenson Center. Undergraduate instructionallaboratories are equipped for study of biomedical processes, measurement methods and instrumentation. Thesefacilities are equipped with embedded systems for instrumentation, design, and testing that mirror professionalpractice. Specialized facilities for biomedical imaging, biophotonics, cell and tissue culture, microfabrication, surgeryand intervention, and nanoengineering are used both for faculty-led research and instructional purposes. Undergraduate Honors Program. With approval of the Honors Program director, junior and senior students inbiomedical engineering who have achieved a minimum grade point average of 3.5 may be accepted into theundergraduate Honors Program. Students in the program take at least 6 credit hours of 5000-level or above(graduate) biomedical engineering courses, which can be counted toward the 127-hour undergraduate degreerequirements as biomedical engineering electives or which can be taken for graduate school credit.
