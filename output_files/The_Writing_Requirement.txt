work) and earn a minimum number of 120 earned credit hours in order to graduate. Overview of AXLEAXLE consists of two parts: the Writing Requirement (including a First-Year Writing Seminar) and the Liberal ArtsRequirement. The First-Year Writing SeminarThe First-Year Writing Seminar is an integral part of the first-year experience in the College of Arts and Science.Through these seminars, first-year students engage in independent learning and inquiry in an environment in whichthey can express knowledge and defend opinions through intensive class discussion, oral presentations, and writtenexpression. The small-group nature of these seminars allows for direct student-faculty interaction that stressestraining in techniques of scholarly inquiry. The students’ written work and oral presentations are subject tothoughtful critical review by the faculty member, providing feedback that can be used to reconsider the manner inwhich they articulate their ideas and to refine their skills in these areas. Thus, first-year students learn not onlyabout the subject matter of the seminar, but are also exposed to new methods of acquiring knowledge, differentways of expressing and sharing ideas, and unique opportunities to participate in critical inquiry. All first-year students must enroll in a First-Year Writing Seminar. (First-Year Writing Seminars in the College of Artsand Science are numbered 1111.) This course may be taken during the fall or the spring semester. Students arepermitted to enroll in only one First-Year Writing Seminar per semester. All First-Year Writing Seminars also count intheir appropriate distribution areas within the Liberal Arts Requirement, but a second seminar will not count towardthe writing requirement. Students who transfer into the College of Arts and Science (whether from another school atVanderbilt or from another college or university) do not complete a First-Year Writing Seminar. Students beyondtheir second semester in residence may not register for First-Year Writing Seminars, nor may First- Year WritingSeminars be repeated after completion of the second semester in residence.
