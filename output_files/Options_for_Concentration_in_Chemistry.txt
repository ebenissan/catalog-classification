Other in-depth chemistry courses are Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering3200 and 3250, and Earth and Environmental Sciences 4600, and any 5000-level chemistry lecture courses.(Qualified seniors interested in graduate-level courses must obtain approval from the course instructor, theiradviser, and the director of graduate studies in chemistry. Further details are found in the Academic Policies for theCollege of Arts and Science.) A maximum of 3 credit hours of chemistry research (3860) may be counted as in-depthchemistry course hours. Additional math courses, such as Math 2300 and Math 2820, are highly recommended for the chemistry major. Options for Concentration in ChemistryIn-depth chemistry courses can be chosen so as to define a focus area within chemistry. Students should consultwith their major adviser about focus area options, or to formulate an individualized focus area option. Furtherdescriptions of these options and other recommended courses can be found in the chemistry major handbook on thechemistry department homepage. Chemical Biology Focus. The role of chemical processes in biological systems is fundamental to chemical biology.The journal Nature Chemical Biology defines chemical biology as “the use of chemistry to advance a molecularunderstanding of biology and the harnessing of biology to advance chemistry.” Chemical biology builds upon thedisciplines of medicinal chemistry, biochemistry, pharmacology, genetics, bioorganic and organic chemistry.Suggested in-depth chemistry electives: 3020, 3710, 3860, 4210, 4720. Chemical Sciences Focus. This option provides a broad foundation of chemistry, permitting flexibility in future careerpathways and providing an excellent preparation for positions in chemical industry and for graduate programs inchemistry. Suggested in-depth chemistry electives: 3120, 3300, 3310, 3860. Page 324 of 1019
