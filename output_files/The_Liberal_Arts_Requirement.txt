(other than ENGL 1100 or a First-Year Writing Seminar) no later than the fourth semester. All Arts andScience W courses also count in their appropriate distribution areas within the Liberal Arts Requirement.d. All students must successfully complete either a second Arts and Science W course (other than ENGL 1100 ora First-Year Writing Seminar), or an approved course in oral communication (CMST 2100, 2110, 2120) atVanderbilt University, regardless of AP or IB credits, SAT scores, or ACT scores earned prior to Oralcommunication courses focus on developing improved public speaking skills. These courses introducestudents to the principles and practices of public discourse and reasoned argument. Attention to the processof effective oral communication is integral to these classes. Students receive regular speaking assignmentsthroughout the semester and regular feedback to enhance effective speaking skills. All students mustcomplete Part d of the Writing Requirement before graduation.The Liberal Arts RequirementThe Liberal Arts Requirement consists of successful completion of thirteen courses from the College of Arts andScience. Most courses in the College of Arts and Science fulfill one of these Liberal Arts requirements. Courses mustcarry three or more credits to count toward the AXLE Liberal Arts Requirement. Although some courses may beappropriate to more than one requirement, each course will fulfill only one requirement. These thirteen coursesmust be distributed as outlined below. They must be taken from at least seven departments or subject areas. a. Humanities and the Creative Arts — HCA (3 courses)Courses in the humanities and the creative arts challenge students to examine their personal understanding of lifeand how their individual experiences overlap with those of the rest of humankind. These courses testify to thevarying ways in which people think, form values, confront ambiguity, express spiritual and aesthetic yearnings, andgrapple with moral and ethical problems. By analyzing and interpreting literary, philosophical, religious, or artisticworks, students examine the foundations of human experience. By producing original artistic works in imaginativewriting, studio art, theatre, film, music, and dance, students have the opportunity to connect the universal sourcesof human inspiration with their own creative processes. b. International Cultures — INT (3 courses)The study of international cultures provides students with a basis for understanding the diversity of experiences andvalues in our contemporary, global society. Options in this category include not only international history andcultural studies courses, but also courses in literature, cinema and media arts, the social sciences, art, music, andlanguages. Students may satisfy this requirement by choosing courses that focus on the history and culture of asingle society or time period in human history and/or that represent a broad spectrum of different human societiesand time periods.Language courses introduce students to the language of a different culture and provide insight into that culture inways that are not possible to achieve through detached study. At intermediate and advanced levels, students areable to explore the culture in depth, using the language itself to read, discuss, and write about its various aspects.Even at the most basic level, exposure to the language of a different culture prepares students to think and act interms of living in a global community. Intermediate and advanced language courses prepare students for study abroad programs, which the College ofArts and Science strongly recommends. A maximum of one course in this requirement may be satisfied throughstudy abroad in a Vanderbilt-approved program. A summer study abroad program must earn 6 or more credit hoursto satisfy this requirement. The Global Education Office maintains a list of pre-approved programs. Note: All students who study abroad must register their travel in advance with Vanderbilt’s international securityprovider. Registration is completed on your behalf if you enroll in a program offered through the Global EducationOffice. Otherwise, information is available on the GlobalVU website: vanderbilt.edu/global.

All students must complete three courses in this category, irrespective of previous language study or proficiency in  a language other than English. At least one of the three courses presented in fulfillment of this category must be asecond-semester (or higher) language acquisition class taught at Vanderbilt University (or through the Duke–UVa–Vanderbilt Partnership for Less Commonly Taught Languages), unless the student successfully demonstrates proficiency in a language other than English at or above the level achieved by second-semester languageacquisition classes taught at Vanderbilt University. Students may demonstrate proficiency in a number of ways: SATSubject Test scores (French, 540; German, 470; Hebrew, 530; Italian, 540; Japanese with Listening, 440; Latin, 530;Spanish, 520); by appropriate score on proficiency tests (written and oral) administered by the Tennessee LanguageCenter; or with AP or IB credit in a foreign language. The first semester of an introductory language acquisition classin any language a student has studied for at least two years in high school, or in which a student transfers creditfrom another institution, cannot be used in partial fulfillment of this requirement. Intensive elementary languagecourses that cover the content of two semesters in one shall count as one course toward this category. Students who, because of special ability and achievement, are admitted to the College of Arts and Science withoutthe normally required two years of one foreign language in high school must enroll in a foreign language courseduring their first semester and must remain continuously enrolled until they successfully complete a full year of oneforeign language. They must complete this requirement by the end of their fourth semester in the College of Artsand Science. c. History and Culture of the United States — US (1 course)The study of the history and culture of the United States provides students with a basis for understanding theAmerican experience and the shaping of American values and viewpoints within the context of an increasingly globalsociety. Interpreting history and culture in the broadest sense, options in this category include traditional history andcultural studies courses, but also courses in literature, cinema and media arts, the social sciences, art, and music,which illuminate historical periods or cultural themes in United States history. Students may satisfy this requirementby choosing a course that focuses on the history and culture of a single social group or time period in Americanhistory and/or that represents a broad spectrum of different social groups and time periods. d. Mathematics and Natural Sciences — MNS (3 courses, one of which must be a laboratory science)Courses in mathematics emphasize quantitative reasoning and prepare students to describe, manipulate, andevaluate complex or abstract ideas or arguments with precision. Skills in mathematical and quantitative reasoningprovide essential foundations for the study of natural and social sciences. Students are generally introduced tomathematical reasoning through the study of introductory courses in calculus or probability and statistics. Courses in the natural sciences engage students in hypothesis-driven quantitative reasoning that helps to explainnatural phenomena, the roles of testing and replication of experimental results, and the processes through whichscientific hypotheses and theories are developed, modified, or abandoned in the face of more complete evidence, orintegrated into more general conceptual structures. Laboratory science courses engage students in methods ofexperimental testing of hypotheses and analysis of data that are the hallmarks of the natural sciences. Naturalscience courses prepare students to understand the complex interactions between science, technology, and society;teach students to apply scientific principles to everyday experience; and develop the capacity to distinguishbetween science and what masquerades as science. e. Social and Behavioral Sciences — SBS (2 courses)Social scientists endeavor to study human behavior at the levels of individuals, their interactions with others, theirsocietal structures, and their social institutions. The remarkable scope represented by these disciplines extendsfrom studying the underpinnings of brain function to the dynamics of human social groups to the structures ofpolitical and economic institutions. The methods employed by social scientists are correspondingly broad, involvingapproaches as varied as mapping brain activity, discovering and charting ancient cultures, identifying the societalforces that shape individual and group behavior, and using mathematics to understand economic phenomena. Bystudying how humans and societies function, students will learn about individual and societal diversity, growth, andchange.Page 108 of 1019
