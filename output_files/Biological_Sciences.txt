Chemical Biology Laboratory (3 credit hours) â€” BCB 3201, BCB 4966 General Electives (6 credit hours)Electives may be chosen from any of the following:BCB 2101, BCB 3101, 3201, 4320, 4966; BME 2200, 3000, 4400, 4410, 4500; BSCI 2201, 2210, 3230, 3234, 3245,3247, 3252, 3256, 3270, 3630, 4265, 4266, 4274; CHEM 2100, 3020, 3300, 4230, 4720; CS 1101, 1103, 2204; NSC2201, 3245, 3260, 3269, 3274, 3891, 4961 Courses taken to fulfill track requirements are not eligible for elective credit. Honors ProgramStudents in either Biochemistry or Chemical Biology track may apply to the Honors Program if they hold a minimumcumulative GPA of 3.3 and a GPA of at least 3.4 in courses that count toward the major at the end of their junioryear. The purpose of the Honors Program is to provide students with an intensive independent research experiencein a host laboratory. Honors candidates must complete two semesters (3 credit hours each semester) of HonorsResearch (BCB 4999). The successful completion of one semester of BCB 4999 may substitute for the BCB 4965course requirement. Upon entering the program at the end of the junior year, candidates assemble a committee ofthe major research adviser and two additional faculty members appropriate to the area of research. As part of theresearch course work, the candidate will write an honors thesis. At the end of the graduating semester, honorscandidates must submit a written thesis and give an oral defense of their research.
