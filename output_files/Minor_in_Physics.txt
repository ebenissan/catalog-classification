1. Accelerated Calculus I (1300) and Accelerated Calculus II (1301);2. Multivariable Calculus (2300) or Multivariable Calculus and Linear Algebra (2500 and 2501); and3. Methods of Ordinary Differential Equations (2420) or Ordinary Differential Equations (2610).In addition, for physics majors considering post-graduate work in physics or in a related field, the following PHYS andMATH courses are strongly recommended as electives:1. Electricity, Magnetism, and Electrodynamics II (PHYS 2291), Quantum Mechanics II (PHYS 3652),Mathematical Methods of Physics (PHYS 4005); and2. Methods of Linear Algebra (MATH 2410) or Linear Algebra (MATH 2600); Introduction to Probability andMathematical Statistics (MATH 2820); Statistics Laboratory (MATH 2820L); Complex Variables (MATH 3110);Introduction to Partial Differential Equations (MATH 3120); Fourier Analysis (MATH 3130); and AdvancedEngineering Mathematics (MATH 3600).Licensure for TeachingCandidates for teacher licensure in physics at the secondary level may qualify by taking the basic physics majortogether with the requisite education courses described in the chapter on Licensure for Teaching in the PeabodyCollege section of this catalog.Honors ProgramThe Honors Program in the Department of Physics and Astronomy is designed to allow a student to engage in advanced research under the guidance of a faculty member, usually in an area related to an ongoing researchprogram  in the department. A student majoring in physics interested in Honors (Honors in Physics or Honors inAstronomy) will work with a faculty mentor to develop an appropriate research project that will be conducted underthe guidance of that faculty member. The Honors project must have a substantial grounding in physics orastronomy, but may be conducted under the direct supervision of any faculty member in any department atVanderbilt. To be admitted to the Honors Program, a student must submit a two-page research proposal describingthe plans for their Honors project, which must be approved by the director of the departmental Honors Program. Inaddition, a student must have completed 2953L, either 2255 or 3651, and meet the minimum GPA requirements forhonors programs of the College of Arts and Science. To graduate with honors, a student mustHave at least a 300 cumulative GPA and a 3.300 GPA in courses that count toward the major.Earn a minimum of 6 credit hours in research classes (3850, 3851, 4998), leading to an honors thesis, with atleast 2 of these credit hours earned in A student who earns credit for 3852 may satisfy this portion of therequirement with 3 credit hours of research earned at Vanderbilt, including at least 2 of these credit hours in4998.Write a senior thesis of high merit, as evaluated by the student’s Honors Examination Committee; the thesismay be submitted either in the fall or spring semester of the senior year.Demonstrate high attainment on an oral honors examination in which they present and defend their work tothe student’s Honors Examination Committee; the oral examination may take place either in the fall or springsemester of the senior year.Departmental MinorsThe physics and astronomy minors are suitable for students who wish to supplement a related discipline or simplyhave a general interest in the field. Research is not a requirement for either minor.Minor in PhysicsThe minor requires a minimum of 19 credit hours of course work, distributed as follows: Page 443 of 1019
