encountered in an individual course of study. Students who minor in nanoscience and nanotechnology learn the principles and methods used in this rapidlygrowing field. Its core originates in the physical sciences by providing key approaches for describing the behavior ofmatter on the nanoscale. Synthetic approaches are used to manipulate matter systematically, for creating uniquelyfunctional nanomaterials that can be inorganic, organic, biological, or a hybrid of these. With a third component ofcharacterization, a process for designing systems to have particular properties as a result of their composition andnanoscale arrangement emerges. Students are introduced to these areas through foundational and elective coursesfor the minor that are specified below, the latter of which can be selected to fulfill the degree requirements for theirmajor. The minor in nanoscience and nanotechnology is supported by the Vanderbilt Institute of Nanoscale Science andEngineering (VINSE) that brings together faculty from the College of Arts and Science, the School of Engineering,and the Medical Center. A specialized laboratory facility maintained by VINSE provides students in the minor withcapstone experiences that allow them to prepare and characterize a variety of nanostructured systems using in-house state-of-the-art instrumentation. This hands-on laboratory component enhances the attractiveness ofstudents to both employers and graduate schools.Nanoscience and Nanotechnology MinorThe minor in nanoscience and nanotechnology requires a total of 15 credit hours, distributed as follows: 1.
