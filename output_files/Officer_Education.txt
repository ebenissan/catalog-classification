Liberal Arts CoreIn order to provide the elements of a general education considered necessary for responsible practice as aneducated engineer, the School of Engineering requires each student to complete at least 18 hours in the Liberal ArtsCore comprising:1. At least 3 hours selected from courses classified in the AXLE Curriculum Course Distribution as Humanitiesand Creative Arts (HCA), with the exception of CMST 1500, 2100, 2110, and 2120, and2. At least 3 hours selected from courses classified in the AXLE Curriculum Course Distribution as Social andBehavioral Sciences (SBS).The remaining hours are to be selected from:1. Courses classified in the AXLE Curriculum Course Distribution as Humanities and Creative Arts (HCA),International Cultures (INT), History and Culture of the United States (US), Social and Behavioral Sciences(SBS), and Perspectives (P)2.

MS 1510ImmersionImmersion Vanderbilt (vanderbilt.edu/immersion) allows students to pursue a multi-year path to be curious, todevelop their passions and to learn by experience. To fulfill the university requirement of Immersion Vanderbilt, astudent must participate in immersive experiences and then complete a culminating project that is based on onespecific immersive experience as described in the Special Programs for Undergraduates section near the start of thiscatalog.The experiential learning may focus on one or more areas of student interest. Most engineering students will takeadvantage of a four-year engineering design experience to satisfy the requirements of Immersion Vanderbilt. Eachengineering major offers such a multi-year experience within its curriculum. Students whose plans includeprofessional development may also pursue industrial internships. A research path can engage the student indiscovery through research in engineering or other fields. While most engineering students will select an immersionexperience associated with their major, students can pursue an Immersion plan outside their home program. Forexample, students interested in creative expression might develop a performance piece, exhibit, or artistic work,while those interested in international study may explore firsthand the culture, language, and history of othercountries. Students interested in such immersion plans should consult the Office of Experiential Learning andImmersion (EL&IV). The Immersion Vanderbilt process is composed of several phases. Senior design projects in the School ofEngineering satisfy the final project requirement for Immersion Vanderbilt, with students presenting the results oftheir design project at the school's Design Day or Computer Science Immersion Showcase. For students completingother immersion projects, the Office of Experiential Learning and Immersion Vanderbilt coordinates a series ofshowcases open to the entire campus where students display their projects. Upon completion of the project, Officeof Experiential Learning and Immersion Vanderbilt conveys that the requirements have been met by showingcompletion of the Immersion Vanderbilt graduation requirement on the student's degree audit.Open ElectivesCourses taken beyond specified courses and restricted (such as program, technical, and liberal arts) electives for themajor may be taken as open electives.Officer EducationCourse offerings in military science and naval science are described in the section on Special Programs forPage 176 of 1019
