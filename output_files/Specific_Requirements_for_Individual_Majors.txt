Cellular Biology (MCB) major, and for the Ecology, Evolution, and Organismal Biology (EEOB) major. Studentswith specialized interests within either of the specialized majors may substitute one of the intermediatecourses with an upper- level course with the permission of the director of undergraduate studies and theBiological Sciences Curriculum Committee (Intermediate Biological Sciences courses: 2101, 2201, 2201L,2205, 2210, 2210L, 2218, 2219, 2238, 2238L, 2520).All majors must complete at least 2 credit hours of 3965, 3850, or 3861, though only one semester of 3965may count toward the 30 credit hours.A total of no more than 7 credit hours of 3850, 3861, or 3961 may count toward the major.If option 1 (see below) is used to meet the laboratory requirement, then BSCI 3965 or 2 credit hours of 3850 isrequired.Either BSCI 3229 or BSCI 3270, but not both, may count toward the major or minor.For Honors, additional requirements must be met. For entry into Honors, students must satisfy the conditionsrequired by the College of Arts and Science for admission to departmental honors programs. Students must have anoverall grade point average equal to or greater than 3.3, and a grade point average in courses required for theappropriate biological sciences major equal to or greater than 3.4 at the time of entry. Applications must beapproved by a majority vote of the faculty of the department. To receive honors or highest honors in biologicalsciences, a student in the departmental Honors Program must:Complete the requirements for either the MCB, BioSci, or EEOB major, achieving a minimum cumulativegrade point average of 3.4 in all courses that count toward the major;Satisfactorily pursue a research project under the supervision of the adviser with a minimum of 10 credithours of Honors Research, BSCI 4999;Give a progress report to the Honors Committee at the end of the first semester of This will consist of a short,written progress report to be distributed to the Honors Committee one week before an oral presentation andmeeting with the committee. The meeting must be scheduled before the start of finals week;At the end of the second semester of Honors Research, prepare a thesis based on the research project, to beread and evaluated by the Honors Committee;Present the thesis orally before the Honors Committee and faculty in the Department of Biological Sciences.Minor in Biological SciencesA minor in biological sciences requires a minimum of 18 hours including at least 9 credit hours earned in residenceat Vanderbilt. Credit hours for the minor must include BSCI 1510â€“1511b; 1510L and either 1511L or 1512L; 2210;and one other intermediate course. No more than 2 credit hours of 3860, 3861, 3850, and 3961 may be countedtoward the minor. Specific Requirements for Individual Majors
