Students are also required to complete several prerequisites toprepare them for the major. Students may not double count any single course for both a required part of the coreand for an elective. The proposed core is interdisciplinary and includes rigorous course work drawn from political science, economics,sociology, anthropology, and history. The core provides all PPS students training in the politics, economics, methods,social contexts, history, and ethics of public policy. In addition to developing skills in the core curriculum, PPS students seek more intensive training within areas ofconcentration. The boundaries of these areas are not mutually exclusive, and together they span a wide range ofpolicy concerns and disciplinary perspectives. Among the five elective courses, students must take three courses ina single area of concentration. It is also recommended that students choose electives from at least two disciplines. Students pursuing the “economic policy” concentration must take at least two upper-level electives in economicsfrom the list (numbered above 3000).PrerequisitesPPS majors must have earned credit for MATH 1201 or 1301, or higher; basic statistics (ECON 1500 or 1510 or bothMATH 2820L and either 2810 or 2820); and introductory courses in political science and economics (PSCI 1100,ECON 1010, and ECON 1020).Core Curriculum (5 courses, 15 credit hours)PSCI 2256 or PPS 21003 credit hoursECON 3010, 3012, 3020, or 30223 credit hoursECON 3032, 3035, 3050; SOC 3002; or HOD 25003 credit hoursPPS 2200 and 22506 credit hours If a student cannot take both 2200 and 2250, they may, with prior approval from the director or associate director ofPublic Policy Studies, substitute one course from ANTH 3122, 3133, 4152; HIST 2722; PSCI 3253; SOC 3315, 3604,3605, 3613, 3614.Electives and Areas of Concentration (5 courses, 15 credit hours)The track is intended to allow students to go more deeply into one area of public policy (for example: health policy,STEM policy, education policy, criminal justice policy).
