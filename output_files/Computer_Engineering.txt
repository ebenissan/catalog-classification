The program provides a strong engineering background centered on digitaltechnology combined with an understanding of the principles and techniques of computer science. Computerengineering is design-oriented. The basic principles of engineering and computer science are applied to the task athand, which may be the design of a digital processor, processor peripheral, or a complete digital processor-basedPage 340 of 1019
