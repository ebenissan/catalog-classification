Training provided by the quantitative methods minor canprovide a competitive edge on the job market or for future graduate study. Many advances in quantitative methodsused in the social sciences and education are not covered in standard undergraduate introductory statistics courses.This minor exposes students to more recent developments in quantitative methods with concrete applications topractice. The quantitative methods minor helps students become better consumers and producers of scientificresearch. Students will have the opportunity to learn from leading experts in the statistical analysis of social sciencedata.Structure of the MinorPrerequisite for the minor is completion of the introductory statistics sequence that is already required by theundergraduate psychology majors. This sequence is: PSY-PC 2110 or PSY 2100 or ECON 1500 or MATH 2810 or a 5 on AP Stat ExamAndPSY-PC 2120. Statistical Analysis (3 hours) The quantitative methods minor is an 18-hour minor. The 18 hours include both PSY-PC-2110 (or PSY 2100 or ECON1500 or MATH 2810 or a 5 on AP Stat Exam) and PSY-PC 2120, and these serve as prerequisite courses for theelectives. Following completion of these prerequisite courses (6 hours; required), the minor requires four additionalcourses (12 hours; electives). Any four courses offered by the Quantitative Methods program are applicable. Atmost, three hours of directed research/independent study can count toward the minor. Students with interest indirected research/independent study can contact individual quantitative methods faculty directly. Courses that would satisfy the elective requirements (pick 4):PSY-PC 3722.
