manufacturing, and software packages that employ machine learning to optimize both the geometry and function ofparts and processes, have reached a level performance that enables their widespread integration throughoutmanufacturing operations. Digital fabrication is the process of converting ideas to physical products throughcomputer-driven design and manufacturing. Every aspect of the design process can be simulated, from materialsselection to the toolpaths used to manipulate those materials. Consequently, digital fabrication technologies moreefficient manufacturing of prototypes and commercial parts. This minor is intended for students who are interestedin 3D printing, computer aided design (CAD), and product development. The minor in Digital Fabrication prepares students for this area by providing both classroom and hands-oninstruction in advanced technologies used to prototype physical devices through computer-controlled design andmanufacturing. Students will learn how to scale-up production of their prototypes through both traditional andadditive-based manufacturing techniques. Students will gain experience through foundational courses for the minorand expand their application through electives often related to their major. The Vanderbilt makerspace ecosystemprovides students in the minor with hands-on experiences that allow them to design, construct, and iterateprototype devices using in-house state-of-the-art equipment. This laboratory component enhances thecompetitiveness of students to both employers and graduate schools. The minor in digital fabrication requires 15 credit hours, distributed as follows: 1. Programming: One of CS 1100, DS 1100, CS 1103, CS 1104, or CS 22013 hours2. Prototyping Core: DF 2100, CHBE 42006 hours3.
