Courses selected from theCollege of Arts and Science must be designated a Mathematics and Natural Sciences (MNS) course in theAXLE curriculum.a. School of Engineering courses except CS 1000, 1151; DS 1000, 3850, 3851, 3891; ENGM 2440, 3350,4800; ES 2700, 2900, 3884; and any course numbered 2860b. Mathematics courses numbered 2420 or higher except MATH 3000c. Chemistry courses numbered 2000 or higherd. Physics courses numbered 2000 or highere. Astronomy coursesf. Biological Science coursesg. Earth and Environmental Science coursesh. Neuroscience courses          At least 3 hours of technical electives must be numbered 2000 or above.8. Professional (ME) depth (a minimum of 9 hours). Each student must choose at least 9 hours of ME electivecourses. No more than 6 hours of 3850 and 3860 combined can be credited toward ME depth electives.No one-credit-hour ME course except 3841 can be used as a mechanical engineering elective. A maximum of threeone-credit-hour ME courses may be used as technical electives. Additional ME one-credit-hour courses can be openelectives. At least one “W”-designated course (3 hours) in the English language must be included on a graded basis. Undergraduates in mechanical engineering may apply the pass/fail option only to non-departmental courses takenas open electives, technical electives, or part of the liberal arts core, subject to the school requirements for pass/fail.Specimen Curriculum for Mechanical Engineering  Semester hours  SOPHOMORE YEAR FALLSPRINGME 2160Introduction to Mechanical Engineering Design3–MATH 2300Multivariable Calculus3–MATH 2420Methods of Ordinary Differential Equations–3PHYS 1602, 1602LGeneral Physics II and Laboratory4–CE 2200Statics3–ME 2171Instrumentation Laboratory–2ME 2190Dynamics–3ME 2220Thermodynamics–3ECE 2112Circuits I–3Page 424 of 1019
