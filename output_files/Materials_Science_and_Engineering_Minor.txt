Many of the barriers to widespreadincorporation of alternate and renewable energy, from higher-capacity, more robust, less expensive batteries forenergy storage, to high efficiency/low cost solar devices, involve the need for new materials. Materials will play anever-increasing role in health care. New medical devices, drug delivery systems, and synthetic biological tissue arejust a few of the health-related applications in need of new materials for their success. In addition, materialschallenges are front and center in the ever-evolving areas of electronic devices. Engineers and scientists withknowledge of materials science and engineering concepts are needed to address these and many more materialschallenges. Materials science and engineering is an interdisciplinary program with affiliated faculty from all engineeringdisciplines, as well as faculty from chemistry, and physics. Two undergraduate options involving materials scienceand engineering are available. Students pursuing a B.S. in engineering science may choose a program concentrationin materials science and engineering. This option requires the student to take MSE 1500, 1500L, and 2500, andother materials science and engineering elective courses to complete their 24 hours of engineering programelectives. Students pursuing a B.E. in an engineering discipline can earn a minor in materials science andengineering. The minor in materials science and engineering provides the student with an understanding of engineeringmaterials. It complements and adds to the studentâ€™s major in one of the engineering disciplines, exposing thestudent to an interdisciplinary approach to problem solving. The minor program in materials science andengineering requires 16 hours of program courses, of which 7 hours are devoted to MSE 1500, 1500L and MSE 2500.No more than 10 hours below the 2500 level may be applied to the minor. 1.
