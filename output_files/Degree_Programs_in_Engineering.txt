Degree Programs in EngineeringUndergraduate DegreesThe First YearMathematics and PhysicsLiberal Arts CoreImmersionOpen ElectivesOfficer EducationMaster of EngineeringDigital Learning Programs  Bachelor of engineering degree programs are offered in the areas of biomedical, chemical, civil, electrical andcomputer, environmental, and mechanical engineering. Many of these programs allow considerable flexibility—butstudents are required to include in their courses of study those bodies of knowledge fundamental to that discipline. Bachelor of science degree programs are offered in computer science and engineering science. The latterinterdisciplinary engineering discipline allows strong concentration in other areas of engineering or outside of theSchool of Engineering.  The school offers the master of engineering (M.Eng.), with emphasis on engineering design and practice, in mostareas of study. The Graduate School, through departments of the School of Engineering, offers the research-orientedPh.D. and M.S. degrees in eight major fields. Degree programs offered by the School of Engineering are shownbelow.Degree Programs in Engineering B.E.B.S.M.Eng.M.S.Ph.D.Biomedical Engineering• •••Chemical Engineering• •••Civil Engineering• •••Computer Science • ••Cyber-Physical Systems  •  Electrical and Computer Engineering•  ••Engineering in Surgery and Intervention  •  Engineering Management  •  Engineering Science •   Environmental Engineering• •••Interdisciplinary Materials Science   ••Mechanical Engineering• •••Risk, Reliability, and Resilience Engineering  •    Page 174 of 1019
