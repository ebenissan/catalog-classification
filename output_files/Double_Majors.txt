students to develop individually through independent study and research. General requirements are described inthe Special Programs chapter. The chemical and biomolecular engineering department requires a minimum overallGPA of 3.5. Acceptance to the program is made by petition to the faculty during the junior year. Transfer studentsmay be considered for admission after completing one semester at Vanderbilt. Candidates for honors choose theirtechnical courses with the consent of a faculty honors adviser. Requirements include at least 6 hours of CHBEcourses numbered 5000 or above, plus 6 hours of CHBE 3860 and 3861 taken in the junior and/or senior year underthe direction of a faculty honors adviser. A formal written research report is submitted each semester CHBE 3860 or3861 is taken with a final report and presentation given in the spring semester of the senior year to the CHBEfaculty and students. The diploma designation is Honors in Chemical Engineering. Facilities. The Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering department is located in Olin Hall. Undergraduateinstructional laboratories are equipped for study of transport phenomena, unit operations, kinetics, and processcontrol. Current research areas for which facilities are available include molecular modeling; colloid and surfacescience; biochemical engineering and biotechnology; materials processing and characterization; energy and theenvironment.
