They may be taken only by students who have been appointed College Scholars by the dean of theCollege of Arts and Science. Some College Scholars are appointed before they arrive for their first semester inresidence; others may be appointed on the basis of their records in that first semester. All first-year students in theCollege of Arts and Science may apply to the associate dean for honors programs for admission to the CollegeScholars program; only first-year students are considered for admission. Honors seminars offered in the College Scholars program provide an especially interesting and challenging way forCollege Scholars to complete certain parts of the program for Achieving Excellence in Liberal Education (AXLE). They are designed to cover topics through the intensive analysis afforded by the seminar setting and format. Anhonors seminar will satisfy the requirement for a first-year writing seminar. Honors 1810W, 1820W, 1830W, 1840W,1850W, and 1860W count toward the AXLE requirements identified by the seminars’ titles. Honors 1810W areHumanities and the Creative Arts (HCA) courses; Honors 1820W are Perspectives (P) courses; Honors 1830W areSocial and Behavioral Sciences (SBS) courses; Honors 1840W are History and Culture of the United States (US)courses; Honors 1850W are Mathematics and Natural Sciences (MNS) courses; Honors 1860W are InternationalCultures (INT) courses. In addition to regular credit hours and grade points, honors seminars carry honors points toward graduation with thedesignation “Honors in the College of Arts and Science.” College Scholars must earn fifteen honors points to receivethat designation (they are not required to earn this designation but may take as many honors seminars as theywish). They may earn up to thirteen of the required fifteen points in honors seminars: three points each for the first timethey take Honors 1810W, 1820W, 1830W, 1840W, 1850W, or 1860W; one point if they take a second seminar in thesame area.
