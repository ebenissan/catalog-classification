Honors Program in Climate StudiesMinor in Environmental and Sustainability Studies DIRECTOR OF UNDERGRADUATE STUDIES Zdravka Tzankova (Climate and Environmental Studies) COURSES OFFERED: ENVS Human beings and their societies necessarily interact with and alter the Earthâ€™s natural environment. Climate andEnvironmental Studies (CES) is home to two interdisciplinary undergraduate programs. Both the Climate Studiesmajor (CLIM) and the Environmental and Sustainability Studies (ESS) minor allow the student to examine humaninteraction with the environment by concentrating on methods in the natural sciences, humanities and socialsciences with some experience in the other areas of study as well as environmental engineering and socialengagement. The major, in particular, is designed to provide students with a strong foundation in the full range ofdisciplinary perspectives across the humanities, natural sciences and social sciences. Program of Concentration (I) in Climate Studies The major requires 30 credit hours. Some of the courses require prerequisites, and students are responsible formeeting those prerequisites if they choose to satisfy the major with those classes. 1. Climate Studies introduction: ENVS 11012. Climate science foundation: EES 2110 or EES 33103. Core humanities course. One course in the humanities with climate-related focus: ASIA 2308, CSET 3320W,ENGL 3731, HART 3233, HIST 1530, RLST 34724. Core social sciences course. One course in the social sciences with climate-related focus: ANTH 1111, 2114,2225; ECON 4050 Topics in Econometrics, when offered as Environmental Econ and Policy; PSCI 3266; SOC3311, 3317, 33195. Core natural sciences course. One course in the natural sciences with a climate-related focus: EES 1081,2510, 3333, 4440, 4650, 4680, 47506. Methods and practices courses. Two courses from the following: ANTH 2400, 3120, 3125, 3261; BME 2400; CE3300; CMST 1501, 3800; CSET 2100, 3257; CS 1000; 2204, DHUM 1100, 1200; DS 1000, 1100, 2100, 3100;ECON 1500, 1510, 3035; HART 1740W, 2815; HIST 1515; HODC 3222; MATH 1010, 1100, 1201, 1301, 2810,2821; PSY 2100, PSY-PC 2120; SOC 2100, 30027.

Students interested in pursuing the Honors Track should contact the director of undergraduatestudies for more information. To be considered for the Honors Track in Climate Studies, a student must have aminimum cumulative GPA of 3.4 and a minimum GPA of 3.6 for courses that count toward the major. Studentsshould express interest to the director of undergraduate studies before March 1 of their junior year. Students whoare recommended for the program by the director of undergraduate studies will typically begin the program bytaking ENVS 4101W during the fall term of the senior year.  Page 338 of 1019 
 The Honors Track requires the following: 1. Successful completion of requirements 1-7 in Program I, for a total of 30 credit hours. Requirements 1, 2, and 6must be completed prior to beginning the honors courses.   2. Successful completion of at least two semesters of honors coursework (6 credit hours) for the Honors Track.Students take ENVS 4101W or ENVS 4981 (Honors Research) during the first semester of their senior year, whenthey develop the literature review and research plan. The first semester of honors coursework counts as part ofrequirement 7 of Program I and can be used to fulfill the requirements for Program I should students not go on tofinish honors during the second semester of honors coursework.  After completing the first semester of honorscoursework, students then take a minimum of 3 and maximum of 6 credit hours of 4981 (Honors Research) duringthe second semester, which is in addition to the 30 credits required to complete the standard major. Thus studentsmust take a minimum of 6 credit hours of honors coursework and may take up to 9 credit hours. 3. In order to earn honors in Climate Studies, students must successfully complete, defend, and perform requestedrevisions on the honors thesis before deadlines for graduation. Successful defense of the completed thesis is throughan oral presentation and examination by the thesis adviser and a designated faculty reader near the end of thestudent's final semester. Revisions must be completed and the thesis submitted no later than the last day ofundergraduate classes. 4. Students meeting these requirements receive honors or highest honors in Climate Studies, depending on thequality of the thesis and performance on the defense.  Successful candidates will be recognized in thecommencement program and receive a Vanderbilt diploma that records honors or highest honors in Climate Studies. Comprehensive ExamIn order to graduate with a climate studies major, students must take a comprehensive exam during their senioryear. The exam is not graded, and no grade will appear on the student's transcript. The purpose of the exam is totest the extent to which climate studies majors are retaining core aspects of the climate & environmental studiescurriculum. Minor in Environmental and Sustainability Studies Students who want to minor in environmental and sustainability studies must take a minimum of six courses (18credit hours total) chosen from the courses listed below; additional relevant courses may be counted with approvalof the director of the program. Courses must be distributed as follows: (A) one Natural Science- and Technology-Intensive course; (B) one Humanities course; (C) one Social-Behavioral Sciences and Policy-Intensive course; (D) twoadditional courses from B and/or C; and (E) a capstone course. No more than two courses may be at the 1000 level.In addition,  no more than 3 credit hours may be counted simultaneously toward both the environmental andsustainability studies minor and any other major or minor. Topics courses may count toward the minor with approvalof the director. A.
