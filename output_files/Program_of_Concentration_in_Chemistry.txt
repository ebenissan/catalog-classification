This is accomplished byproviding students with a solid background in the disciplines of organic, analytical, inorganic, biological, and physicalchemistry. The core courses in these areas, which are supported by a variety of practical experimental experiencesin the laboratory, provide students with the skills needed to think critically about chemistry. After these corecourses, students delve deeper into an area of their choice. Recognizing the importance of research, whichintegrates and makes sense of our collective body of knowledge, we encourage students to participate inundergraduate research. The chemistry major at Vanderbilt University meets the guidelines for the AmericanChemical Society approved program of study in chemistry. Program of Concentration in ChemistryThe chemistry program is organized into four parts. The first part is a general chemistry course sequence (CHEM1601–1602 and 1601L–1602L or AP credit) to serve as an entry point into the major. The second part consists offoundation courses in the five major disciplines of chemistry: analytical (2100), biochemistry (BSCI 2520), inorganic(3010), organic (2221–2222 or 2211–2212), and physical (3300 or 3310). The third part of the chemistry majorconsists of completing 8 credit hours of laboratory past 1601L–1602L. Four credit hours are from laboratory courses(2221L–2222L, 2100L, and 3315) associated with foundation courses. There are also 6 credit hours of a capstonelaboratory (4965–4966) designed to provide advanced laboratory experience. The fourth part of the major consistsof completing a minimum of 6 credit hours of in-depth chemistry courses. These in-depth courses build upon thecontent of foundation courses or integrate concepts from these foundational disciplines. Required Non-chemistry CoursesPage 323 of 1019
