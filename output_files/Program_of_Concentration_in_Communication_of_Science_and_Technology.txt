Ornes COURSES OFFERED: CSET The Program in Communication of Science and Technology (CSET) sits at the intersection of the sciences and thehumanities, and it builds on the vast amount of effort at Vanderbilt devoted to interdisciplinary work that spans thenatural sciences, engineering, the social sciences, and the humanities. CSET draws on both the scientificcommunities (natural sciences, social sciences, engineering, medicine) and the creative communities (publicspeaking, writing, digital media production) across multiple colleges at Vanderbilt. CSET is designed for students who have an interest in science and technology and also are interested incommunicating science and technology to both peer-professional audiences and to the larger world. CSET is ideal asa second major for students pursuing a first major in one of the natural sciences, any of several of the socialsciences, engineering, the Science, Medicine and Technology concentration in History, and the Creative Writing trackin English. In the twenty-first century scientists must be able to communicate their work and their ideas to theirprofessional peers, to nonspecialists who review grant proposals, and to lay audiences who ultimately fund,support, and benefit from the discoveries made in laboratories around the world. In return, the scientific communityneeds support from professional writers, journalists, technical writing specialists, public speakers, film and videowriters and producers, and bloggers in communicating modern science, technology, and medicine to lay audiences.Program of Concentration in Communication of Science and TechnologyTrack 1: Standard track [at least 42 credit hours] 1.

These courses bridge the sciences and the humanities and include but are not limited to coursescovering the history of science, the history of medicine, climate studies, MHS, the philosophy of science, andethics and science.4. Natural Science and/or Engineering Depth [15 credit hours]A combination of any five three-credit-hour courses that are identified as MNS courses (if in A&S) or School ofEngineering courses. Students may count any one statistics course toward this requirement from thefollowing list: BME 2400, 3400, BSCI 3270, CE 3300, ChBE 3900W, ECON 1500, 1501, MATH 1011, 2810,2820, PSY 2100, PSY-PC 2110, 2120, SOC 2100.
