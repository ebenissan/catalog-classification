computing experience to provide undergraduate students with a solid foundation in the discipline. Emphasis is oncomputing activities of both practical and intellectual interest, and on theoretical studies of efficient algorithms andthe limits of computation. Computer facilities are available for class assignments, team projects, and individualstudies. The minor in computer science requires 15â€“16 hours of computer science courses as follows: 1. Programming: CS 1101 or 11043 hours2. Discrete Structures: CS 22123 hours3. Intermediate Computer Concepts: CS 22013 hours4. CS 2281 (and 2281L) or ECE 2281 (and 2281L), or CS 3250, or CS 32513-4 hours5. One additional CS course numbered 3000 or above (excluding CS 3262)3 hoursTotal:15-16 hours COURSES OFFERED: CSData Science MinorDIRECTOR Charreau Bell Data Science is an emerging interdisciplinary field whose goal is to extract knowledge and enable discovery fromcomplex data using a fusion of computation, mathematics, statistics, and machine learning. Datasets can be asvaried as maps of the universe, MRI images, human genomes, medical records, stock market transactions,educational data, historical texts, infrastructure systems, or website clickstream data. Over the coming decades,Data Science is expected to have significant impacts on basic and applied research in the sciences, social sciences,arts and humanities, and engineering as well as impact all sectors of the economy from health care to education,government, transportation, finance, manufacturing, construction, and urban planning. Data Science has thepotential to improve individual and community health and education; develop smart communities that enableefficient circulation of people, goods, and services; enable informed decision making in public and private sectors;and enhance environmental sustainability and overall quality of life. Given the wide range of applications andpotential benefits, the powerful tools and techniques of Data Science must be used ethically and responsibly. The faculty at Vanderbilt have created a unique trans-institutional undergraduate minor in Data Science that spansall four undergraduate colleges and is affiliated with the Vanderbilt Data Science Institute. Students in Data Scienceare introduced to the foundations of this interdisciplinary field, with coursework in computer programming,statistics, machine learning, and visualization, interwoven with ethical considerations of collecting, curating,analyzing, visualizing, and interpreting data. The minor in Data Science prepares students for advanced courseworkin statistics and data analysis, scientific computing and simulation, machine learning and visualization, and highperformance computing and big data. The minor strives to prepare students for unique immersion experiences inbasic and applied research, for civic and professional engagement in the public and private sectors, and forinternational experiences in industry, government, or non-governmental organizations. The minor provides a solidfoundation for future professions or graduate study in any field that collects, analyzes, models, or interprets data. Page 221 of 1019
