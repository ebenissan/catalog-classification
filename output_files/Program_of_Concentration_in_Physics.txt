 The Society of Physics Students arranges informal discussions.Program of Concentration in PhysicsThe departmental major provides a thorough grounding in the core areas of physics. It is suitable either aspreparation for careers in science and engineering or as a springboard for applying technical knowledge in suchfields as business, medicine, law, public policy, and education. The major in the Department of Physics andAstronomy consists of 31–32 credit hours of course work, distributed as below. Students considering majoring inphysics are strongly encouraged to consult with the director of undergraduate studies before registering for classes.1. Core courses covering the major subdisciplines of physics — Students must complete four of the following (12credit hours): Modern Physics and the Quantum World (2255); Classical Mechanics (2275); Electricity,Magnetism, and Electrodynamics I (2290); Statistical Physics (3200); Quantum Mechanics I (3651).2. Laboratory work — Students may not use AP credit to satisfy any portion of the laboratory sequencerequirement (3–4 credit hours):a. Laboratory Principles I (1912L), Laboratory Principles II (2255L), and Introduction to ExperimentalResearch (2953L); orb. 1501L or 1601L, 1502L or 1602L, 2255L, and 2953L if the student has entered the major by taking theintroductory physics course sequence 1501 or 1601, 1501L or 1601L, 1502 or 1602, and 1502L or1602L. Students considering majoring in physics who begin in 1501 or 1601 and 1501L or 1601L in thefall semester are encouraged to take the combination 1502 + 1912L or 1602 + 1912L in the springsemester.3. Electives (9 credit hours) — Pedagogical course work in physics and/or astronomy; research hours (3850,3851, 4998) do not count toward this requirement. The course electives may be taken from any 2000-level orhigher PHYS or ASTR courses not used to satisfy any other requirement of the major. Other courses maycount as electives, such as courses offered by the engineering school (or other departments and schools) thatare particularly relevant, such as a course in environmental studies, health physics, optics, or materialsscience. Such exceptions must be approved by the director of undergraduate studies.4. Capstone (7 credit hours) — Computational Physics (3790), 3 credit hours of research (3850, 3851, or 4998)taken across one or more semesters, and the Seminar in Presenting Physics Research (3600). Physics-relatedresearch done in other departments and programs, supervised by Vanderbilt faculty and pre-approved by thedirector of undergraduate studies, is also permitted in satisfaction of the research requirement.Immersion Experience: A student majoring in physics may choose to complete their Immersion Experience throughan enhanced research program within the disciplines of either physics or astronomy. To complete the ImmersionExperience in physics or in astronomy, physics majors must complete at least 5 credit hours of research and earn 1credit hour from PHYS 3600 (Seminar in Presenting Physics Research) and 3 credit hours from PHYS 3790(Computational Physics). At least 2 of these credit hours in research must be earned in either 3851 (UndergraduateImmersion Research) or 4998 (Honors Research). The other three (3) credit hours may be from any combination of3850, 3851, and 4998. Credit hours in research may be from PHYS, from ASTR, or from a combination of PHYS andASTR courses. Computer Science course work: All 2000-level and higher PHYS courses assume students have working skills inprogramming. These skills may be learned outside of a regular course, but should be equivalent to that taught in CS1104 Programming and Problem Solving. Students who do not already have these skills are strongly advised to takethis class in the first semester, prior to beginning the three-semester laboratory sequence in the second semester.In addition, the following Computer Science and/or Scientific Computing courses are strongly recommended for allphysics majors: Program Design and Data Structures (CS 2201) or Program Design and Data Structures for ScientificComputing (CS 2204); Algorithms (CS 3250) or Scientific Computing Toolbox (SC 3250); and High PerformanceComputing (SC 3260). Physics majors pursuing a second major or minor in computer science should take CS 2201;physics majors pursuing a minor in scientific computing should take CS 2204. Mathematics course work: All physics majors are expected to have high-level skills in mathematics in order to besuccessful in PHYS classes and to prepare for graduate work. MATH courses are not formally required for the majorin physics; however, most physics courses identify MATH prerequisite or co-requisite courses in order to indicate themathematical skill-level assumed for that class. Multivariable calculus is a co-requisite for 2255 and a prerequisite forall other 2000-level or higher PHYS courses. Physics majors are expected to develop a working knowledge of single-variable calculus, multivariable calculus, and ordinary differential equations. The following courses are thosestrongly recommended for physics majors:Page 442 of 1019
