The major is designed to provide astrong background in the social and behavioral sciences related to child development, a focused understanding ofthe scientific study of children and the contexts in which they develop, and opportunities for supervised andindependent research on aspects of child development in ways that enable students to link theories and priorresearch to research design and data on childrenâ€™s development. The major is excellent preparation for graduatestudy in selected social science and professional fields (e.g., psychology, medicine, nursing, education, publicpolicy) and offers an excellent complementary (or second) major for undergraduate students simultaneouslypursuing a major in cognitive studies, elementary education, human and organizational development, or specialeducation. The child development curriculum is designed to ensure that students develop a background in the liberal arts andsciences; a clear understanding of the theories, major research findings, and research methods central to the field ofchild development; and an area of focus or expertise in child development. Development of background in theliberal arts and sciences occurs within the context of the Liberal Education Core, composed of required and electivecourses in communications, humanities, mathematics, natural sciences, and social sciences. A clear understandingof theory and research central to the field is developed through the major core courses. These include an overviewof child development, courses focused on the domains of psychological processes central to human development(cognition; social and personality development), courses related to major epochs of child development (infancy andadolescence), and courses devoted to the major research methodologies in the field (experimental, observational,psychometric). Students select an area of concentration (major elective area) to complement the field as a whole.Page 254 of 1019
