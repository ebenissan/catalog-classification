Note that only physics majors pursuing honors inastronomy are eligible to enroll in 4998.6  Total credit hours:  16 Introductory Courses - Physics1001, 1010, 1020,1010L, 1111, 1501, 1501L, 1502, 1502L, 1601, 1601L, 1602, 1602L, 1911, 1912, 1912L, 2255L Introductory, calculus-based physics is offered at several different levels, each with the appropriate laboratory. Onlyone of 1501/1601/1911 and one of 1502/1602/1912 may be taken for credit. Physics 1501–1502/1601L–1602L isintended for students in the health sciences. Physics 1601–1602/1601L–1602L is intended for students inengineering. Physics 1911–1912 and the labs 1912L-2255L are intended for students planning to major in physics orpursue research-oriented careers in science, engineering, or mathematics; however, students may major in physicsafter starting in any of these three introductory physics sequences. Prospective majors are strongly advised tobegin their study of physics in the fall semester of their freshman year whenever possible, although with carefulplanning it is possible to complete the physics major with a later start. Physics 1010 /1020 is intended for studentswithout strong backgrounds in mathematics or science who have a general interest in the subject. 1010/1020 is notrecommended as preparation for further study in a natural science, is not appropriate for engineering, premedical,or pre-dental students, and does not count toward the physics major or minor.
