which people learn to think, solve problems, and reason. The major encourages the development of flexiblereasoning and problem-solving skills that are useful in a wide variety of endeavors. The major is excellentpreparation for graduate study in the social and behavioral sciences as well as for areas (such as medicine and law)that place importance on inquiry and clear thinking. The curriculum is planned to ensure that students receive a strong background in both science and the liberal arts,with an emphasis on problem solving and complex decision making. The courses in the core curriculum focus onvarious aspects of human cognition, including communication, cognitive development, basic cognitive processes,applications of theories of knowledge, and sociocultural aspects of learning. Students are encouraged to consulttheir advisers about pursuing a second major or developing an area of concentration that is consistent with theircareer plans. The major also emphasizes an appreciation of the scientific method and the research process;numerous opportunities exist to pursue independent study in close collaboration with faculty members. Leadership and success in our society will depend increasingly on one’s ability to process complex information,solve difficult problems using systematic analysis, and facilitate the learning of others. The knowledge andexperience gained by students in cognitive studies will allow them to be full participants in the society of learnerswho represent the future.Honors ProgramThe Honors Program in cognitive studies offers qualified majors the opportunity to conduct individual researchprojects in collaboration with faculty members. This research experience culminates in the writing and publicpresentation of a senior thesis. Students who major in cognitive studies are eligible to apply for the Honors Programat the end of their sophomore year if they have an overall grade point average of at least 3.2 and a 3.2 in cognitivestudies courses. Students who complete the program successfully and who have a final grade point average of atleast 3.2 will receive Honors or Highest Honors in cognitive studies. The program should substantially aid thoseintending to do graduate work. More specific information concerning admission to and the requirements of theHonors Program is available from the director of the Honors Program, the director of undergraduate studies, or thedepartment education coordinator.CurriculumStudents take a minimum of 120 hours, distributed as follows:Liberal Education Core Requirements.
