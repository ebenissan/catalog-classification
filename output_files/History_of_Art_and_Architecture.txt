Many students will use the program in history of artand architecture as a foundation for careers in which analytical reading and writing skills gained in the major areespecially valued: as the basis for advanced training in professional schools (such as architecture, law, medicine,journalism, and business), for postgraduate work in history of art or architecture, and for employment in galleries,museums, or design-related fields. The department helps students become readers of visual images and materialculture throughout their lives, and encourages visual approaches to learning. In addition, the department providespractical experience in research, writing, and exhibition organization that are key to pursuing museum and gallerycareers, as well as courses in museum studies. Majors in history of art and architecture participate in the activities of the Vanderbilt History of Art Society, thestudent architecture group, and work closely with departmental advisers. The History of Art Society and thedepartment sponsor events such as panels, lectures, debates, and other programs where majors meet and engagein discussions with historians of art and museum curators. The department curriculum complements those of related departments and programs, including African Americanand Diaspora Studies, American Studies, Anthropology, Asian Studies, Cinema and Media Arts, Classical andMediterranean Studies, European Studies, Gender and Sexuality Studies, Latin American, Caribbean, and LatinxStudies, and Religious Studies.
