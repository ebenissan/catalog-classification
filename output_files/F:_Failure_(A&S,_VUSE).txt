All Fâ€™s are counted in the computation of grade point averages,except when a course is repeated and is subsequently passed. In this case the latest grade is used for computationof the grade point average (but the grade originally earned is not removed from the transcript). A course in whichthe grade F is received must be repeated as a regular course if credit is to be given. It may not be repeated as acourse in independent or directed study, under the procedures for credit by examination, or on a P/F basis. Engineering: A subject in which the grade F is received must be taken again in class before credit is given. Astudent who deserts a course without following the correct procedure for withdrawing from it will receive an F in thecourse.Page 73 of 1019
