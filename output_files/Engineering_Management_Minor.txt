Caleb Clanton Engineering management is an interdisciplinary program of study designed to expose engineering students to theconcepts and theories of the management of the engineering function, the critical elements of technologydevelopment and innovation, and the implementation of such ideas in manufacturing, engineering, and technologyenvironments. Approximately two-thirds of all engineers spend a substantial portion of their professional careers asmanagers. In the complex, competitive world of technology-driven industry, skilled engineers who understand theessential principles of management and business have a competitive advantage. The program in engineering management prepares students to work effectively in developing, implementing, andmodifying technologies and systems. The ability to manage and administer large technical engineering and researchprojects and budgets will continue to challenge engineering management skills. The engineering management minor is designed to provide a working knowledge of the fundamentals ofmanagement and innovation. The minor program consists of 15 hours of course work, some of which may be taken as electives associated withthe studentâ€™s major program. Five courses are required: four core courses and the remaining course chosen from alist of electives. Page 227 of 1019
