3. At least 6 credit hours not used to satisfy item 2 from 2800 or above.Completion of a single-variable calculus sequence (1300–1301) is a prerequisite for the minor, but does not counttoward the credit hours of the minor. Licensure for TeachingCandidates for teacher licensure at the secondary level in mathematics should refer to the chapter on Licensure forTeaching in the Peabody College section of this catalog. CalculusSeveral calculus sequences are available: 1100; 1200–1201; 1300–1301–2300; 1300-1301-2310. The courses in these sequences cover similar material, but at different rates, and therefore overlap in content andcredit. Students should not switch from one to another without approval of the department. Such switching mayresult in loss of credit. Students intending to take mathematics classes beyond one year of calculus are advised toenroll in the 1300–1301–2300 sequence or in the 1300-1301-2310 sequence. First-year students with test scores of 5 on the Calculus BC advanced placement examination, thereby earning APcredit for 1300–1301, may choose to enroll in the 2500–2501 sequence. The combination of 2500–2501 is a blend ofmultivariable calculus and linear algebra, with an emphasis on rigorous proofs.
