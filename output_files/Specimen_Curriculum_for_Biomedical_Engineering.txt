Honors Program must also complete a two-semester-long research project and present a research report; this isgenerally accomplished through the BME 3860 and 3861 Undergraduate Research elective courses. Honors studentsmust make a grade point average of 3.0 in these classes and maintain an overall 3.5 GPA to be designated as anhonors graduate. The diploma designation is Honors in Biomedical Engineering. Curriculum RequirementsThe B.E. in biomedical engineering requires a minimum of 127 hours, distributed as follows:1. Mathematics (15 hours): MATH 1300, 1301, 2300, 2400.2. Basic Science (20 hours): CHEM 1601, 1601L, 1602, 1602L; PHYS 1601, 1601L, 1602, 1602L; BSCI 1510,1510L. 3. Engineering Fundamentals (6 hours): ES 1401, 1402, 1403; CS 1100 or 1101 or 1103 or 1104. (CS 1103 isstrongly recommended except for students minoring in Computer Science).4. Electrical Engineering (3 hours): ECE 2112.5. Biomedical Engineering (38 hours): BME 2100, 2301, 2302, 2400, 2900W, 3000, 3301, 3302, 3400, 3500,3900W, 4901W, 4950, 4951, 4959.6.
