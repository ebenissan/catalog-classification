chemistry, molecular and cellular biology, biophysics, and engineering. Chemical biology and biochemistry usechemical insight, techniques, and tools to study or manipulate biological systems. They are the cornerstones ofmedical technology and therapeutics. To provide students with training in modern principles at a chemistry-biologyinterface, Vanderbilt’s interdisciplinary major in biochemistry and chemical biology incorporates expertise frommultiple departments in the university. Students receive a broad background in the natural sciences (chemistry,biology, physics) and mathematics, followed by fundamental core training in principles of biochemistry and chemicalbiology that involves both theoretical and laboratory course work. Students then pursue an area of emphasis ineither biochemistry or chemical biology through upper-level elective courses. Students participate in independentresearch in laboratories of biochemistry and chemical biology faculty. Additional research experience is available inthe Honors Program. Program of ConcentrationThe biochemistry and chemical biology major tracks share fundamental core elements but have a distinct set offoundational courses, track-specific electives, and laboratory requirements. All students are required to complete aset of basic science and mathematics courses. The major consists of 32 credit hours beyond these basic science andmathematics courses. All students complete 12 credit hours of core courses, 14 credit hours of either biochemistryor chemical biology track, and 6 credit hours of general electives. For suggested paths of completion, see theProgram in Biochemistry and Chemical Biology website. Required Math and Science Courses for Both Tracks(38 credit hours) Biological Sciences — BSCI 1510, 1511, 1510L, and either 1511L or 1512LChemistry — CHEM 2221 or 2211, CHEM 2222 or 2212, CHEM 2221L and CHEM 2222LMathematics — MATH 1200 or 1300 and MATH 1201 or 1301Physics — PHYS 1501 or 1601, PHYS 1502 or 1602, PHYS 1501L or 1601L, and PHYS 1502L or 1602L Note: These credit hours do not count toward the major. AP credit may satisfy some of these requirements.
