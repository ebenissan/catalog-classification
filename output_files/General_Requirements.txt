The Department of BiologicalSciences offers courses that address all of these levels and programs of study for undergraduates and for graduatestudents seeking the Ph.D. For undergraduates, the department offers three majors and a minor. All three majors have honors tracks. TheBiological Sciences (BioSci) major is designed for the student seeking a broad base in the biological sciences; it is ahighly flexible program that allows a certain amount of specialization in upper-level courses. The Molecular andCellular Biology (MCB) major is designed for students with an interest in developing an in-depth understanding ofhow living systems function at the molecular and cellular levels, with upper-level course options ranging in contentfrom biophysics and biochemistry to developmental biology, and to molecular aspects of evolution. The Ecology,Evolution, and Organismal Biology (EEOB) major is designed for students with an interest in the areas of biology thatspan genomics, ecology, evolutionary biology, comparative genomics, organismal biology, and conservation biology.The department also offers a minor in biological sciences for students majoring in other disciplines. Interestedstudents should consult the director of undergraduate studies. The department offers undergraduates opportunities for engaging in faculty-led research projects for course credit.Students may receive an introduction to the workings of a scientific laboratory through an internship, or a moreintensive, hands-on experience in directed or independent laboratory research. Students on the honors track of anyof the three majors carry out a major honors research project and write an honors thesis. More information aboutthe majors and minor offered by the department, the honors track of each major, and research opportunities opento undergraduates is available at our website: as.vanderbilt.edu/biosci. Students may declare only one of the majors offered by the Department of Biological Sciences; double or triplemajors within the department are not permitted. It is strongly recommended that all students take one year ofcalculus or calculus/statistics, and one year of physics. Students are encouraged to work with their major advisers tochoose upper-level courses appropriate to their chosen majors. General RequirementsAll students in programs of concentration offered by the Department of Biological Sciences must take twosemesters of general chemistry and lab (Chemistry 1601–1602 and 1601L–1602L) and two semesters oforganic chemistry (Chemistry 2211/2221–2212/2222) and lab (2221L–2222L).A total of 30 credit hours of Biological Sciences courses, including the 8 credit hours of 1510–1511 and 1510Land either 1511L or 1512L, is required in all majors.Courses numbered below 1500 do not count toward the major or minor.Below is a listing of the required courses for the Biological Sciences (BioSci) major, for the Molecular andPage 311 of 1019
