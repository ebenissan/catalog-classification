COURSES OFFERED: PHIL The Department of Philosophy at Vanderbilt offers a wide range of courses relating philosophy to various dimensionsof human concern. The department emphasizes three broad areas of scholarly and teaching excellence: ethics, social and politicalphilosophy, and the history of philosophy.Program of Concentration in PhilosophyThe program of concentration should be tailored to the needs and interests of the student. The following distributionof courses is required as part of the major. Logic: 1003 or 3003 (at least 3 credit hours); Ethics: 1005, 3605, 3606, or3606W (at least 3 credit hours); History of Philosophy: 2100, 2101, 2102, 2103, or 2104 (at least 6 credit hours). Anyalterations must be approved by the director of undergraduate studies. We encourage all majors to work closelywith their advisers to select courses that form a coherent whole. The student must take at least 30 credit hours inthe major field of which at least 21 credit hours must be in courses beyond the 1000 level. Honors ProgramThe Honors Program offers opportunities for advanced study in philosophy, including independent research projectsand/or enrollment in certain graduate seminars (with permission of the instructor). To be admitted to the program,the student must: (a) be a major in philosophy; (b) have a grade point average of 3.3 in all courses; (c) have a 3.5grade point average in philosophy courses; and (d) develop a written proposal for advanced study in consultationwith a philosophy faculty sponsor. Students who satisfy these requirements should meet with the director ofundergraduate studies to review their programs, whereupon the director may nominate the students for honorswork. Honors work typically begins in the junior year or in the first semester of the senior year; students in theprogram must complete at least 3 credit hours of Philosophy 3999. Students who successfully complete the programwhile maintaining the grade point averages of 3.3 generally, and 3.5 in the major, will receive honors in philosophy;students who do especially distinguished work will receive highest honors. Minor in PhilosophyThe minor in philosophy consists of 18 credit hours, including at least 12 credit hours in courses beyond the 1000level. The minor program will be constructed so as to provide a broad grounding in philosophy and to complementthe studentâ€™s other studies. Each program must be approved by the director of undergraduate studies. Note: 1002 or 1002W or 1005 or 1111 are ordinarily taken prior to all other philosophy courses, except 1003 and3003 (logic courses), 3616 (philosophy of science), and 3013 (aesthetics).Physics and AstronomyProgram of Concentration in PhysicsLicensure for TeachingHonors ProgramDepartmental MinorsMinor in PhysicsMinor in AstronomyIntroductory Courses - PhysicsIntermediate Courses - PhysicsAdvanced Courses - PhysicsPage 440 of 1019

In keeping with this crucial role, the Department of Physics and Astronomy offers coursesdealing with both the cultural and intellectual aspects of the disciplines, a broadly based major program flexibleenough to serve as preparation for graduate study in physics, applied physics, medical physics, astronomy orastrophysics, professional study in another area, or technical employment, and minor programs for studentsdesiring to combine physics or astronomy with other majors. An honors program is available for qualifieddepartmental majors. A distinguishing feature of the Vanderbilt undergraduate curriculum is the close coupling between teaching andresearch. At Vanderbilt, active research groups are studying the physics of elementary particles; nuclear structureand heavy-ion reactions; nonlinear interactions of lasers with materials at ultrafast time scales; the behavior ofelectrons, atoms, molecules, and photons near surfaces; the electric and magnetic properties of living systems; thestructure and dynamics of biopolymers; young stars; and cosmology. All professors are engaged in research, andundergraduate students can participate in this research informally or through independent study or summer work.Page 441 of 1019
