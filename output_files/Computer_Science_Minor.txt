Aminor offers students more than a casual introduction to an area, but less than a major. A minor is not a degreerequirement, but students may elect to complete one or more. Courses may not be taken on a Pass/Fail basis. Aminor for which all designated courses are completed with a grade point average of at least 2.000 will be entered onthe transcript at the time of graduation. When a minor is offered in a discipline that offers a major, only those courses that count toward the major may becounted toward the minor. Students should refer to the appropriate sections of this catalog for specificrequirements. Minors are offered in computer science, digital fabrication, electrical and computer engineering,energy and environmental systems, engineering management, environmental engi​neering, materials science andengineering, nanoscience and nanotechnology, quantum information science and engineering, scientific computing,and most disciplines of the College of Arts and Science, Blair School of Music, and Peabody College. Students declare their intention to pursue a minor by completing the online Major/Minor Declaration/Changeworkflow process found here: https://registrar.vanderbilt.edu/registration/forms.php. Departments and programsassign advisers to students who declare minors in their areas. Students are responsible for knowing and satisfyingall requirements for the minors they intend to complete.Computer Science MinorDIRECTOR Aniruddha Gokhale The program in computer science blends scientific and engineering principles, theoretical analysis, and actualPage 220 of 1019
