Each student shall complete at least one immersive experience, followed by a\nculminating project. At its core, Immersion Vanderbilt gives every Vanderbilt student the opportunity to pursue\nintellectual curiosities through immersive experiences and culminating projects that are as creative and unique as\nthe students. Throughout the Immersion Vanderbilt program, students are supported by faculty and the Immersion\nVanderbilt office.\n \nImmersion Vanderbilt is a requirement for all undergraduates. Some majors, minors, programs of study, and classes\nare approved to satisfy the immersive experience, culminating project, or both. To complete the Immersion\nVanderbilt requirement, students engage in one or more experiential learning activities, for which the student has a\nfaculty or staff mentor. The student will complete their immersive experience in one of the six immersion pathways\nof their choosing: 1) Research; 2) Study Abroad; 3) Innovation, Arts, & Design; 4) Civic & Community Engagement;\n5) Leadership & Professional Development; or 6) Internships. When a student engages in research for Immersion, a\nVanderbilt faculty member must be the mentor. Throughout the program, students are prompted to reflect upon\ntheir immersive experiences, which can inform the development of the culminating project. This reflective process\nensures that students gain a deeper understanding of their immersive experience(s) and its significance to their\ngoals.\n \nUpon completing their immersive experience(s), students plan and complete their culminating project. Although\nstudents are encouraged to base their culminating project on their immersive experience(s), this is not required; the\nculminating project can relate to an immersive experience already completed or a new topic. As with the immersive\nexperience, the student completes their culminating project in one of the six immersion pathways: 1) Research; 2)\nStudy Abroad; 3) Innovation, Arts, & Design; 4) Civic & Community Engagement; 5) Leadership & Professional\nDevelopment; or 6) Internship. The format of the culminating project can take many forms, including oral\npresentations, poster presentations, artistic displays at a showcase, performances, design projects, videos,\nwebsites, prototypes, white papers, or senior theses, among others. The Immersion Vanderbilt faculty adviser\nguides the creation of the culminating project, assesses its quality, and marks it as complete.\n \nWhen the Immersion Vanderbilt faculty adviser approves the culminating project submission, the Immersion\nVanderbilt requirement is complete and cannot be changed. Completion of the Immersion Vanderbilt graduation\nrequirement is noted on the student\u2019s degree audit and the student transcript is updated with the culminating\nproject title and project pathway. More information about Immersion Vanderbilt can be found at:\nhttps://www.vanderbilt.edu/immersion/.\nHoogland Undergraduate Business Program\nVanderbilt University offers a transinstitutional, interdisciplinary undergraduate minor in business that is\nadministered by the Owen Graduate School of Management. The undergraduate business minor requires 16.5 credit\nhours and is directed by Gary Kimball. Professor Kimball also serves as the director of undergraduate studies for the\nprogram.\n \nThe Hoogland Undergraduate Business Program (BUS) provides students with a rigorous exposure to the\nfundamental business disciplines of financial reporting, finance, organizational behavior, marketing, and operations.\nThe program also intentionally grounds the study of business within the liberal arts tradition, allowing students to\nunderstand the context within which business operates in society.\n \nStudents declaring the undergraduate business minor (BUS) may not also declare either of the minors in human and\norganizational development (HOD) or engineering management (ENGM).

    "Army Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC)": "Military Science Department\nMilitary Science Courses\n \n \nThe Army Reserve Officers\u2019 Training Corps (ROTC) is a sequential and progressive academic program that provides\npre-commission training for college-educated men and women who desire to serve as commissioned officers in the\nactive Army, Army Reserve, and Army National Guard. As the Army\u2019s largest commissioning source, it fulfills a vital\nrole in providing mature young men and women for leadership and management positions in an increasingly\ntechnological Army. Admission is open to both men and women who meet mental, moral, and physical\nqualifications.\n \nTraining goes beyond the typical college classroom and is designed to build individual confidence and self-\ndiscipline, instill values and ethics, and develop leadership skills. The course load consists of one course per\nsemester. Each succeeding year will address course topics in greater depth as students receive feedback on their\nleadership style and assume positions of greater responsibility within the program. Graduates are commissioned as\nSecond Lieutenants and will enter active duty with follow-on employment in the Army Reserves, National Guard, or\nactive duty. Educational delays may be granted for graduates who desire to pursue advanced degrees prior to entry\non active duty.\n \nAll university students in the Nashville area may participate in the Army ROTC program at Vanderbilt University.\nWhile Vanderbilt serves as the host university, students at partnership schools are not charged additional tuition to\ntake military science courses. Grades are transferred back to each university and added to the students\u2019 transcripts.\n \nScholarships. Students can earn merit scholarships in several ways. High school seniors and graduates compete for\nfour-year scholarships that are determined by local competition among Vanderbilt applicants. Although determined\nlocally, the application process is centrally managed. Scholarship students receive financial benefits that cover the\ncost of full tuition scholarships each year, an annual $1,200 book allowance, all uniforms, and a monthly tax-free\nstipend of $420. Vanderbilt University also provides Vanderbilt ROTC scholarship students an additional $6,000\ntuition grant each year for room and board.\n \nStudents who are not on scholarship receive the monthly stipend during their junior and senior years. All students\nPage 26 of 1019\nenrolled in the Army ROTC program are provided textbooks and uniforms at no expense. Contracted non-\nscholarship students also receive the monthly stipend $420. For more information, see the website at\ngoarmy.com/rotc.html.\n \nSummer training. Students have the opportunity to attend several training events over the summer.\n \nAdvanced Camp \u2014 This five-week leadership exercise at Fort Knox, Kentucky, is a commissioning requirement. This\nis normally done between the junior and senior years. Travel, room, and board are provided free, and cadets are\npaid approximately $700.\n \nCultural Understanding and Language Program (CULP) Internships \u2014 Students are encouraged to spend a semester,\nspecial or summer session in academic studies abroad if feasible. Special incentives are available to further attract\nqualified students to these valuable programs.\n \nCadet Troop and Leadership Training Internships (CTLT) \u2014 CTLT Internships are leadership development\nopportunities for students who are placed with military organizations throughout the world to gain perspective and\nunderstanding on the role of the military officer.\n \nCadet Professional Field Training (CPFT) \u2014 Airborne, Air Assault, Mountain Warfare, Robin Sage (U.S. Special\nForces), Helicopter Flight Training, and Sapper.\n \nOther training opportunities exist for qualified applicants who are interested.\n \nCommissioning and career opportunities. A commission in the U.S. Army is a distinctive honor earned through hard\nwork, demonstrated commitment, and a desire to serve the nation. Post-graduate military education, usually\nstarting within six months of graduation and commissioning and continuing through the officer\u2019s service career,\nbegins with the basic officer leadership course followed by officer basic course that qualify new lieutenants in their\nspecific branch of service. Education delays are available for critical specialties requiring postgraduate civilian\neducation such as law and medical degrees.\n \nCourse credit. During the four-year program, Army ROTC students complete eight courses of military science plus\nassociated labs. Academic credit varies by university.\n \nVanderbilt University College Credit: All AROTC courses count toward elective credit. See course descriptions below.\n \nInformation.

Leadership and Personal Development. Leadership is one of the most compelling topics of our\ntime, and might be one of the most important attributes for effectiveness in all levels of human endeavor. The\nsuccess of one of the most admired and respected institutions in our country, the military, is founded upon the\nunderstanding and effective application of leadership, and the development of leaders. This course introduces\nstudents to the personal challenges and competencies that are critical to effective leadership. The focus is on\ndeveloping basic knowledge and comprehension of leadership attributes and core leader competencies in a\nuniversal setting and exploring potential applications of these principles and practices at Vanderbilt, in the military\nand in the corporate world. [1]\n \nMS-PC 1210L. Leadership and Personal Development Lab. Leader development is a continuous process of\ntraining, assessment and feedback with the goal of instilling and enhancing desirable behavior in individuals and\norganizations. Within the military science curriculum, this process is called the Leadership Development Program\n(LDP), modeled after the principles spelled out in Field Manual 22-100, Army Leadership, and is standardized both\non campus and in Advanced Camp environments. The flexible methodology of LDP accommodates personalized,\nindividual development at all levels of proficiency throughout the officer educational experience, from program\nentry to commissioning. The LDP includes basic leadership training, periodic assessment and counseling at both\nteam and individual levels by experienced observers. Trends and deficiencies are identified and addressed with\nretraining and reassessment in a continuous cycle. Effective leader development is progressive, building on lessons\nlearned and maximizing individual potential. This course introduces students to the leadership development process\nby providing structured leadership opportunities in a variety of training settings. Student performance in leadership\nroles is assessed and notable strengths and weaknesses are identified. A plan for improvement is discussed in detail\nduring one-on-one counseling sessions.

    "Psychology": "is the scientific study of brain, behavior, and cognitive processes. At Vanderbilt, the undergraduate\nprogram introduces students to the major areas of contemporary psychology: clinical science, human cognition and\ncognitive neuroscience, developmental psychology, neuroscience, and social psychology. Clinical science studies\nhuman personality, emotion, abnormal behavior, and therapeutic treatments. Human cognition and cognitive\nneuroscience are the study of processes such as learning, remembering, perceiving objects and events, and neural\nmechanisms underlying these processes. Developmental psychology examines human development from\nconception through adulthood, including cognitive, emotional, physical, and social aspects. Neuroscience studies the\nstructure and function of the brain and how nerve cells process sensory information, mediate decisions, and control\nmotor actions. Social psychology examines interpersonal and intergroup relations and the influence of social\nconditions on cognitive, emotional, and behavioral processes.\n \nThe Department of Psychology offers a general program of study for students who desire a broad background in\ncontemporary psychology, as well as an honors program. The department offers a wide variety of opportunities for\nundergraduates to gain research experience through active participation in faculty research projects. Such research\nexperience is considered a fundamental aspect of education in psychological science.\n \nPrograms of Concentration in Psychology\nGeneral Program\nPSY 1200\nPSY 2100 or PSY-PC 2110 (Peabody)\nPSY 2150\n4 Distribution Courses*\n5 Psychology Electives**\nTotal credit hours: 36\nPage 451 of 1019",

The adviser helps the student determine the courses that are most suitable\nfor the chosen major and serves as a mentor to the student.\n \nHowever, enrollment in appropriate courses to fulfill degree requirements and knowledge of university policies and\nregulations regarding courses are the responsibility of the individual student.\nCourse Enrollment & Management\nRegistration (A&S, Blair, VUSE)\nNormal Course Load (A&S, Blair, VUSE, PBDY)\nChange of Course (Blair, VUSE)\nPass/Fail (A&S, Blair, VUSE, PBDY)\nWithdrawal (A&S, Blair, VUSE, PBDY)\nTaking Courses for No Credit (A&S, Blair)\nAuditing (A&S, Blair, VUSE, PBDY)\nIndependent Study (A&S, Blair, PBDY)\nMinimum Graded Credit Hours (A&S)\nDuplication of Course Content (A&S, PBDY)\nRepeated Courses (A&S, Blair, VUSE, PBDY)\nUndergraduate Enrollment in Graduate School Courses (A&S, VUSE, PBDY)\nReserving Credit for Graduate School (A&S, PBDY)\nRegistration (A&S, Blair, VUSE)\nPage 58 of 1019",

The student is responsible for\nproviding the department chair with relevant case documentation, including the original written appeal, the written\nresponses of both the instructor and the DUS, and an explanation as to why the student is dissatisfied with the DUS\u2019s\ndecision to dismiss the case. The department chair will decide the merits of the case and provide written\ndocumentation to all parties as to the decision.

If\nthe DUS is the course instructor, the student may directly petition the department chair in which the course is\nhoused.\n \nThird, if the case is dismissed by the DUS, and the student does not agree with the grounds for the decision, the\nstudent may petition the chair of the department where the course is housed. The student is responsible for\nproviding the department chair with relevant case documentation, including the original written appeal, the written\nresponses of both the instructor and the DUS, and an explanation as to why the student is dissatisfied with the DUS\u2019s\ndecision to dismiss the case. The department chair will decide the merits of the case and provide written\ndocumentation to all parties as to the decision. If the case is determined to have merit, the department chair will\nseek a resolution among the parties involved, including the student, the instructor, and the DUS. If the department\nchair is the course instructor, the student may appeal the DUS\u2019s decision directly to the Undergraduate\nAdministrative Committee using the more general academic appeals process outlined in the previous Appeals\nsection.\n \nFourth, if the case is dismissed by the department chair and the student does not agree with the grounds for the\ndecision, the student may appeal the department chair\u2019s decision to the Undergraduate Administrative Committee\nusing the more general academic appeals process outlined in the previous Appeals section.\nMid-Semester Progress Reports (A&S)\nArts & Science: At the end of the seventh week of each semester, instructors assess the progress of all students in\ntheir classes and report those whose work at that point is deficient or whose work is being harmed by excessive\nabsences. Grades to be reported are C\u2013, D+, D, D\u2013, F, and I (for incomplete, meaning that some work due by that\npoint has not been submitted). Instructors may combine with one of these grades or assign separately a notation of\nexcessive absences from a class.

Deficiencies do not show on transcripts, but information is sent to the faculty advisers and\nmay be sent to parents of those students who have submitted a FERPA Release form indicating permission to\nrelease academic information to specific individuals.\n \nA student who receives a deficiency notice is required to meet with the faculty adviser before the deadline for\nwithdrawal at the end of the week. A student with deficiencies in two or more courses or any senior who receives a\ndeficiency notice is also required to meet with the associate dean before the deadline for withdrawal (usually Friday\nof the week after mid-semester).\nTemporary Grades (A&S, Blair, VUSE, PBDY)\nArts & Science, Blair, Engineering, Peabody: Temporary grades are placeholders that are assigned under\ndefined circumstances and are not replacements for failing grades.

Students enrolled at Blair may receive transfer credit for summer courses taken at another\nregionally accredited two-year or four-year college or university. This may include work at festivals or camps, if\noffered through a regionally accredited institution. To qualify for summer credit, a student must be in good standing,\nconsult the Office of Academic Services, and submit courses for evaluation through the Transfer Credit portal in YES.\nA detailed course syllabus is required in order for a course to be evaluated. Deadline for pre- approval is April 1.\n \nSemester work at another institution. Students wanting to receive transfer credit for a semester of work at another\nregionally accredited institution must receive approval in advance from the associate dean. To qualify for such\ncredit, the student must be in good standing and must present a plan that makes clear the educational rationale for\nsuch work, the ways in which it supplements the Vanderbilt curriculum, and the equivalence of standards to those at\nVanderbilt. Approval of the overall plan must be followed by approval of specific courses by the associate dean and\nsubmission of courses through the transfer credit evaluation process in YES. A detailed course syllabus is required in\norder for a course to be evaluated. Students enrolled full time (i.e., carrying at least 12 credit hours) during a regular\n(fall or spring) semester are assumed to be engaged in full-time study at Vanderbilt. Such students are not\npermitted to take additional course work elsewhere, for transfer credit, during the semester. This includes online  \ncourses as well as courses offered by nearby institutions.\n \nEngineering: Work that a student contemplates taking at a college or university other than Vanderbilt after\nmatriculating to VU is treated as transfer work and must be approved in advance in writing through the YES Transfer\nCredit application. The institution must have appropriate regional accreditation. It is the student\u2019s responsibility to\nprovide all information needed for an assessment of the program and course(s) for which transfer credit is\nrequested. Students must upload a detailed syllabus, which then must be approved by the Office of the University\nRegistrar, the relevant Vanderbilt University department, and the School of Engineering Dean\u2019s Office. Work\ntransferred to Vanderbilt from another institution will not be included in the Vanderbilt grade point average. No\ntransfer credit course in which a grade below C- was earned or that was taken after the start of the penultimate\nVanderbilt semester will be credited toward a degree offered by the School of Engineering. A course a student has\ntaken at Vanderbilt may not be repeated in another institution to obtain a higher grade or to obtain credit. Students\nwho have been dismissed from Vanderbilt and subsequently return to Vanderbilt are not eligible to receive transfer\ncredit for any classes taken during the period of dismissal. Students cannot take courses for transfer credit at or\nthrough another institution while simultaneously enrolled in a semester at Vanderbilt unless authorized in advance\nby the School\u2019s Administrative Committee.\n \nPeabody: Students who transfer from another institution must have a final transcript sent directly to the\nUndergraduate Admissions Office, Vanderbilt University. Upon acceptance, students will be asked to submit course\ndescriptions and syllabi for all proposed transfer credit. Upon acceptance, courses will be evaluated by Vanderbilt to\ndetermine which courses will transfer and which requirements (e.g., Liberal Education Core, professional core) are\nmet by the transfer courses. No course for which a student received the grade D+ or lower will transfer. Course\nwork transferred to Vanderbilt from another institution will not carry with it a grade point average.\nPage 76 of 1019\nTransfer students must complete at least 60 hours of work at Vanderbilt. Two of the four semesters in residence\nmust be the last two semesters of the student\u2019s degree program.\n \nPeabody students who wish to take course work during the summer, or during an academic-year semester, at a\nregionally accredited two-year or four-year college or university and transfer up to 12 hours to Vanderbilt must be in\ngood standing with at least a C average. Prior approval must be granted for all courses to be taken elsewhere. If the\ncourses are to be taken during the academic year, the student must take a personal leave explicitly approved for\nthis purpose by the Peabody Dean\u2019s Office. Students on leave for other reasons (e.g., medical or other personal\nreasons) cannot take course work elsewhere for transfer credit without prior permission. Course work transferred to\nVanderbilt from another institution will not carry with it a grade point average.\n \nRequests to participate in non-Vanderbilt-approved overseas programs for transfer credit will be approved only\nunder exceptional circumstances in which the proposed program represents a truly unique and unusual educational\nopportunity. To apply for approval, the student should complete the transfer of credit application and apply for a\nleave of absence for the relevant semester. The student must be in good standing with at least a 2.700 grade point\naverage as of the date of application, and approval must be granted in advance of the study overseas. Petitions for\nleaves of this type must be filed at least one month before the close of the preceding semester, and final approval\nof such petitions always rests with the dean\u2019s office. It should be noted, however, that if a program has been\napproved by Vanderbilt, students must enroll in the program via the Global Education Office. In no case, after\nmatriculating at Vanderbilt, may a student apply to participate in an approved program for transfer credit through a\ndifferent university, or through an external agency, and then seek to transfer that credit into Vanderbilt.\n \nStudents enrolled full time (i.e., carrying at least 12 credit hours) during a regular (fall or spring) semester are\nassumed to be engaged in full-time study at Vanderbilt. Such students are not permitted to take additional course\nwork elsewhere, for transfer credit, during the semester. This includes online courses, as well as courses offered by\nnearby institutions.\nSummer or Winter Work at Another Institution (A&S)\nArts & Science: Students enrolled in the College of Arts and Science may receive transfer credit for a maximum of\ntwo courses taken during summer or winter at a regionally-accredited institution. To qualify for such credit, the\nstudent must be in good academic standing and must obtain prior authorization from the appropriate department\nby submitting courses through the Transfer Credit Submission application in YES. A detailed course syllabus is\nrequired in order for a course to be evaluated. Such courses cannot fulfill AXLE requirements, count as part of the\nlast 30 credit hours in residence, duplicate a course taken previously, or be taken on a Pass/Fail or similar basis.\nStudents cannot transfer credit for summer or winter work from outside of the country of their permanent home\naddress.\nCredit by Examination (A&S, Blair, VUSE, PBDY)\nArts & Science: In certain circumstances, students may be awarded course credit by departmental examination.\n(This procedure is distinct from the award of credit through the College Board Advanced Placement Tests taken prior\nto the student\u2019s first enrollment.)\n \nStudents who wish to earn credit by departmental examination should consult the Dean\u2019s Office of Undergraduate\nEducation in Arts and Science concerning procedures.

Each\nengineering major offers such a multi-year experience within its curriculum. Students whose plans include\nprofessional development may also pursue industrial internships. A research path can engage the student in\ndiscovery through research in engineering or other fields. While most engineering students will select an immersion\nexperience associated with their major, students can pursue an Immersion plan outside their home program. For\nexample, students interested in creative expression might develop a performance piece, exhibit, or artistic work,\nwhile those interested in international study may explore firsthand the culture, language, and history of other\ncountries. Students interested in such immersion plans should consult the Office of Experiential Learning and\nImmersion Vanderbilt.\n \nThe Immersion Vanderbilt process is composed of several phases. The initial step involves the creation of a plan that\nidentifies the intended Immersive experience. Before students start their immersive experience, they will submit the\nImmersive Experience Declaration Form. Students may submit multiple immersive experience forms throughout\ntheir time at Vanderbilt University. After each experience, a self-reflection component is required.\n \nImmersion Vanderbilt culminates in the creation of a final project arising from one of the experiences. Approval and\nassessment of the project is done by the supervising school or college. Senior design projects in the School of\nEngineering satisfy the final project requirement for Immersion Vanderbilt, with students presenting the results of\ntheir design project at the school\u2019s Design Day. For students completing other immersion projects, Immersion\ncoordinates a series of showcases open to the entire campus where students display their projects. Upon completion\nof the project, Immersion Vanderbilt conveys that the requirements have been met by showing completion of the\nImmersion Vanderbilt graduation requirement on the student\u2019s degree audit and adding the Immersion project to\nthe student\u2019s transcript.\nStudy Abroad (Blair)\nBlair: Five Vanderbilt study abroad programs are coordinated with the degree programs in music: the IES programs\nin Milan, Italy; Vienna, Austria; and in Amsterdam, The Netherlands; the DIS program at the Royal Danish Academy\nof Music in Copenhagen, Denmark, and the IFSA/Butler program at the University of Sydney and Sydney\nConservatorium of Music in Sydney, Australia.

The student must notify the recital hearing committee, in writing, of the hearing date, recital\ndate, time, and place. Senior composition recitals are screened in advance at the department level.\n \nFor a required junior or senior recital, the repertoire will normally encompass three major style periods, as\nappropriate to the medium; at least one work in a contemporary idiom will be included in either the junior or senior\nrecital. For teacher education students, a conducting component must be included on the required senior recital. For\njazz studies students, an original composition or arrangement must be included on the required senior recital. A\nrequired senior recital must also include written or spoken program notes, visual media, or other audience\nengagement component, with the approval of the studio instructor. The hearing committee should hear all of the\nrecital repertoire. Grading of the hearing is on a Pass/Fail basis, with written faculty comments. If a student fails the\nhearing, another must be scheduled. Only two recital hearings in one semester are permitted.\n \nFor students also choosing the senior recital to fulfill Immersion Vanderbilt, the recital program and audience\nengagement component should be a deeper, more intensive project that integrates classroom knowledge with\nexperience. The student will work with the project\u2019s primary Immersion adviser (usually the studio teacher) to\ndevelop a plan relevant to the student\u2019s recital. While there are no specific requirements, examples may be found in\nthe Blair Student Handbook. The student\u2019s Immersion adviser will ultimately decide if the plan fulfills the Immersion\nVanderbilt project.\nRecital and Recital Committee (Blair)\nBlair: For recitals given for credit, the recital committee is the same as the hearing committee whenever possible.\nThe final grade is a composite of those of at least two committee members, including the studio instructor, with the\nstudio instructor\u2019s grade valued at two thirds of the total. Copies of committee member\u2019s grades are kept by the\ninstructor. Recitals not given for credit are not graded; they involve a hearing committee but not a recital\ncommittee.\nRecital Attendance (Blair)\nBlair: Each semester in residence, students (except graduating seniors in their penultimate or final semester) are\nrequired to register for MUSO 1000 and attend weekly student recitals/convocations and a minimum of six Blair\nfaculty or professional concerts or their community equivalents as described on the syllabus. Students must fulfill\nboth aspects of the requirement to pass each semester. The course receives zero credit hours but is graded on a\nPass/Fail basis and listed on students\u2019 transcripts. A temporary final grade will not be granted except in the case of\ndocumented medical emergency.\n \nStudents must register their attendance at each recital. Two absences from Friday afternoon recitals are permitted\neach semester. Under extraordinary circumstances, make-up assignments can be obtained from the recital\nattendance coordinator with the permission of the associate dean. Students must plan and keep up with their\nconcert attendance. Except for weekly student recitals, performances in which students are participants do not fulfill\nthe attendance requirement for the performer. Deadline for completion of all work is listed on the course syllabus for\nMUSO 1000. The first failure would result in the loss of the senior penultimate or final semester exemption.\nAdditional failure(s) would require students to enroll for additional semester(s) until the seven required semesters\nare passed.\nExtracurricular Performance (Blair)\nBlair: Students must be in good standing and have the consent of their private instructors in order to participate in\nany extracurricular performance activities, including in-school collaboration, that are not required by a student\u2019s\ndegree program or honor scholarship.\nCollege of Arts and Science\nCollege of Arts and Science Administration and Faculty\nTimothy P.

Since then, Peabody College has retained its\nheritage while achieving new stature as a place where world-class research is conducted and translated into\nteaching, practice, policy, and service. Peabody's mission is characterized by practice-oriented academic programs,\na strong service ethic, groundbreaking research, and a pressing concern for addressing social problems in domestic\nand international contexts.\n \nThe college\u2019s faculty and students constitute a vibrant intellectual community answering pressing questions and\nexpanding knowledge about PreK\u201312 and higher education, including special education; psychology, especially\nfocused on families and children; the development of individuals and organizations; and educational administration,\nleadership, and policy. Peabody College understands the preparation of researchers, teachers, and leaders as\namong the most important things it does, and that building and sustaining an engaged academic community of\nlearners is central to achieving its mission.\n \nPeabody faculty and students engage in a broad spectrum of basic and applied research to generate new\nknowledge and translate that knowledge into practice. Current research findings inform classroom teaching at\nPeabody in every program. Moreover, Peabody faculty bring an interdisciplinary and entrepreneurial spirit to the\nresearch enterprise.\n \nWorking collaboratively, often through one of the college\u2019s research centers, faculty and students publish and\npresent their findings, apply them in real-world settings, and help to shape public debate about the nature and\nfuture of education and human development.\n \nThe college is devoted to enhancing opportunity in an increasingly diverse society. More than 1,900 students are\nenrolled at Peabody, with more than one-third of them in post-baccalaureate graduate or professional degree\nprograms.\n \nAll teacher education programs are accredited by the Council for the Accreditation of Education Preparation (CAEP).\nCounseling programs are accredited by the Council for the Accreditation of Counseling and Related Education\nPrograms (CACREP).\nCenters and Outreach Efforts\nFor more information about Peabody College's Centers and Outreach Efforts, please see here:\nhttps://peabody.vanderbilt.edu/research/research-centers.\nNext Steps at Vanderbilt University\nNext Steps at Vanderbilt is a four-year, nonresidential certification program for students with intellectual and\ndevelopmental disabilities, providing individualized programs of study in the areas of education, social skills, and\nvocational training. Next steps is a comprehensive transition program designated by the U.S. Department of\nEducation.

However, most students will find that the college computing facilities provide all\nof the computing resources that are needed for success at Vanderbilt.\n \nThe Advising System\nEntering first-year students are assigned advisers from CASPAR (College of Arts and Science Pre-major Academic\nAdvising Resources Center). These \u201cpre-major advisers\u201d counsel students during their first three and one-half\nsemesters, or until the students choose majors, when they are assigned faculty advisers in their major department\nor program. Pre-major advisers are specially trained to help students move efficiently through the requirements of\nAXLE (Achieving eXcellence in Liberal Education) and chart a course of study.\n \nDuring the last two years of study, when a student is acquiring depth of knowledge in a major field, studies are\nguided by a specialist in that field. Students are encouraged to see their faculty advisers at any time, since the\nadvisers are available for guidance and counseling and are faculty members with whom advisees may be studying.\n \nAll students are required to see their advisers prior to registration for each semester.\n \nAdvisers are generally happy to talk over any problems students may have, although their chief function is  \nacademic counseling. In addition, several members of the Dean\u2019s Office of Undergraduate Education, themselves\nteaching faculty members, have as their principal duty counseling students and referring them to sources of\nexpertise on non-academic problems.\n \nPublic Lectures\nTHE BERRY LECTURES.

    "The Advising System": "Entering first-year students are assigned advisers from CASPAR (College of Arts and Science Pre-major Academic\nAdvising Resources Center). These \u201cpre-major advisers\u201d counsel students during their first three and one-half\nsemesters, or until the students choose majors, when they are assigned faculty advisers in their major department\nor program. Pre-major advisers are specially trained to help students move efficiently through the requirements of\nAXLE (Achieving eXcellence in Liberal Education) and chart a course of study.\n \nDuring the last two years of study, when a student is acquiring depth of knowledge in a major field, studies are\nguided by a specialist in that field. Students are encouraged to see their faculty advisers at any time, since the\nadvisers are available for guidance and counseling and are faculty members with whom advisees may be studying.\n \nAll students are required to see their advisers prior to registration for each semester.\n \nAdvisers are generally happy to talk over any problems students may have, although their chief function is  \nacademic counseling. In addition, several members of the Dean\u2019s Office of Undergraduate Education, themselves\nteaching faculty members, have as their principal duty counseling students and referring them to sources of\nexpertise on non-academic problems.\n \nPublic Lectures\nTHE BERRY LECTURES.

It has proved itself perennially flexible and adaptive over the past centuries, and it remains the\nsingle best educational preparation for further, specialized study in the professions (medicine, law, education,\nbusiness, et al.), as well as for doctoral work in the humanities and social sciences and advanced research in the\nsciences. The holistic focus of a liberal education encompasses all areas of human knowledge: the natural and social\nsciences, mathematics, foreign languages and cultures, the arts, and the humanities. The empirical disciplines guide\nus in our efforts to live most productively and efficiently. But the rest of the curriculum\u2014the humanities and the arts\n\u2014makes it possible to reflect upon the right use of the remarkable scientific knowledge we have acquired. In a\nliberal arts education, content is always considered in its larger context. Thus, the reflective and discursive aspects\nof study in the liberal arts call upon students to move beyond the mere acquisition of information to inquire into the\ndeeper issues within their studies, and to connect their learning across disciplines and cultures as they live and work\nin the communal environment of Vanderbilt. The end product of a successful liberal arts education is a thoughtful\ncitizen who is prepared to take up his or her rights and responsibilities in a democratic society, to analyze and\ncritique received information, to articulate the issues at hand or the personal values at stake, and whose intellectual\nlife is marked by ongoing internal dialogue about the quality and meaning of life for him or her, as well as for the\ncommunity at large.\n \nFear No Learning!\nThe interdisciplinary inclination of many courses in the College of Arts and Science is an ideal training ground for\nlearning new methodologies for problem solving in the complex, global world of the 21st century.

    "Where to Get Advice": "Entering students are assigned pre-major advisers from CASPAR (College of Arts and Science Pre-major Academic\nAdvising Resources Center). Pre-major advisers are carefully selected and receive intensive training on how to help\nstudents proceed effectively through the requirements of AXLE and chart a course of study. These advisers will\ncounsel students through their first three and one-half semesters or until they declare a major. At that time,\nstudents are assigned faculty advisers in their major departments. Students are encouraged to see their advisers at\nany time; they must, however, consult their pre-major adviser three times during the first year: during summer\nbefore the fall semester, prior to the opening of enrollment windows for the spring semester, and prior to the\nopening of enrollment windows for the fall semester of their second year. Prior to their first semester, entering first-\nyear students must consult in June with their pre-major adviser who will assist with course selections for registration\nfor the fall and begin to understand each student\u2019s interests and goals.

They must be taken from at least seven departments or subject areas.\n \na. Humanities and the Creative Arts \u2014 HCA (3 courses)\nCourses in the humanities and the creative arts challenge students to examine their personal understanding of life\nand how their individual experiences overlap with those of the rest of humankind. These courses testify to the\nvarying ways in which people think, form values, confront ambiguity, express spiritual and aesthetic yearnings, and\ngrapple with moral and ethical problems. By analyzing and interpreting literary, philosophical, religious, or artistic\nworks, students examine the foundations of human experience. By producing original artistic works in imaginative\nwriting, studio art, theatre, film, music, and dance, students have the opportunity to connect the universal sources\nof human inspiration with their own creative processes.\n \nb. International Cultures \u2014 INT (3 courses)\nThe study of international cultures provides students with a basis for understanding the diversity of experiences and\nvalues in our contemporary, global society. Options in this category include not only international history and\ncultural studies courses, but also courses in literature, cinema and media arts, the social sciences, art, music, and\nlanguages.

Otherwise, information is available on the GlobalVU website: vanderbilt.edu/global.\n \nPage 107 of 1019\nAll students must complete three courses in this category, irrespective of previous language study or proficiency in  \na language other than English. At least one of the three courses presented in fulfillment of this category must be a\nsecond-semester (or higher) language acquisition class taught at Vanderbilt University (or through the Duke\u2013UVa\u2013\nVanderbilt Partnership for Less Commonly Taught Languages), unless the student successfully demonstrates \nproficiency in a language other than English at or above the level achieved by second-semester language\nacquisition classes taught at Vanderbilt University. Students may demonstrate proficiency in a number of ways: SAT\nSubject Test scores (French, 540; German, 470; Hebrew, 530; Italian, 540; Japanese with Listening, 440; Latin, 530;\nSpanish, 520); by appropriate score on proficiency tests (written and oral) administered by the Tennessee Language\nCenter; or with AP or IB credit in a foreign language. The first semester of an introductory language acquisition class\nin any language a student has studied for at least two years in high school, or in which a student transfers credit\nfrom another institution, cannot be used in partial fulfillment of this requirement. Intensive elementary language\ncourses that cover the content of two semesters in one shall count as one course toward this category.\n \nStudents who, because of special ability and achievement, are admitted to the College of Arts and Science without\nthe normally required two years of one foreign language in high school must enroll in a foreign language course\nduring their first semester and must remain continuously enrolled until they successfully complete a full year of one\nforeign language. They must complete this requirement by the end of their fourth semester in the College of Arts\nand Science.\n \nc. History and Culture of the United States \u2014 US (1 course)\nThe study of the history and culture of the United States provides students with a basis for understanding the\nAmerican experience and the shaping of American values and viewpoints within the context of an increasingly global\nsociety. Interpreting history and culture in the broadest sense, options in this category include traditional history and\ncultural studies courses, but also courses in literature, cinema and media arts, the social sciences, art, and music,\nwhich illuminate historical periods or cultural themes in United States history. Students may satisfy this requirement\nby choosing a course that focuses on the history and culture of a single social group or time period in American\nhistory and/or that represents a broad spectrum of different social groups and time periods.\n \nd. Mathematics and Natural Sciences \u2014 MNS (3 courses, one of which must be a laboratory science)\nCourses in mathematics emphasize quantitative reasoning and prepare students to describe, manipulate, and\nevaluate complex or abstract ideas or arguments with precision. Skills in mathematical and quantitative reasoning\nprovide essential foundations for the study of natural and social sciences. Students are generally introduced to\nmathematical reasoning through the study of introductory courses in calculus or probability and statistics.\n \nCourses in the natural sciences engage students in hypothesis-driven quantitative reasoning that helps to explain\nnatural phenomena, the roles of testing and replication of experimental results, and the processes through which\nscientific hypotheses and theories are developed, modified, or abandoned in the face of more complete evidence, or\nintegrated into more general conceptual structures. Laboratory science courses engage students in methods of\nexperimental testing of hypotheses and analysis of data that are the hallmarks of the natural sciences. Natural\nscience courses prepare students to understand the complex interactions between science, technology, and society;\nteach students to apply scientific principles to everyday experience; and develop the capacity to distinguish\nbetween science and what masquerades as science.\n \ne. Social and Behavioral Sciences \u2014 SBS (2 courses)\nSocial scientists endeavor to study human behavior at the levels of individuals, their interactions with others, their\nsocietal structures, and their social institutions. The remarkable scope represented by these disciplines extends\nfrom studying the underpinnings of brain function to the dynamics of human social groups to the structures of\npolitical and economic institutions. The methods employed by social scientists are correspondingly broad, involving\napproaches as varied as mapping brain activity, discovering and charting ancient cultures, identifying the societal\nforces that shape individual and group behavior, and using mathematics to understand economic phenomena. By\nstudying how humans and societies function, students will learn about individual and societal diversity, growth, and\nchange.\nPage 108 of 1019\nf. Perspectives \u2014 P (1 course)\nCourses in Perspectives give significant attention to individual and cultural diversity, multicultural interactions,\nsexual orientation, gender, racial, ethical, and religious issues within a culture across time or between cultures,\nthereby extending the principles and methods associated with the liberal arts to the broader circumstances in which\nstudents live. These courses emphasize the relationship of divergent ethics and moral values to contemporary social\nissues and global conflicts. \n \nThe Major\nAll students must successfully complete a course of study leading to one of the approved major programs in the\nCollege of Arts and Science, or successfully complete an individually designed interdisciplinary major designed in\nconsultation with College of Arts and Science faculty and approved by the Committee on Individual Programs in the\nCollege of Arts and Science.\n \nAXLE Curriculum Course Distribution\nThe distribution of Arts and Science courses into AXLE categories is available in YES. Using the advanced-class-\nsearch dialog box, use the pull-down menu under \u201cClass Attributes\u201d to select an AXLE category.\n \nAXLE, the Major, and the Optional Minor\nCourses used to satisfy requirements of AXLE may also be used to satisfy requirements of the major or the optional\nminor.\n \nAdvanced Placement under AXLE\nWith the exception of basic English composition and the foreign language proficiency requirements, no AXLE\nrequirement may be fulfilled with any form of advanced placement credit (AP, IB, A-level, etc.).\n \nTransfer Credit under AXLE\nGenerally, only courses taken in the College of Arts and Science may be used toward AXLE; however, any college\ncourse credit earned prior to graduation from high school, and transfer credit earned before admission to\nVanderbilt, may be used toward fulfilling AXLE requirements.\n \nArea of Concentration\nDuring the junior and senior years, much of the student\u2019s work is concentrated in one large unit of intellectually\nrelated courses. The program of concentration may be arranged through a single major, an interdisciplinary major,\nor a double major. Each of the three options is described below. A triple major may be declared with the approval of\nthe Administrative Committee.\n \nMajor Field\nUnder this plan, the student majors in one of the recognized fields. There shall not be fewer than 27 credit hours in\nthe major field, but a given department may require up to 48 credit hours.

Undergraduates with strong academic records may apply for admission to the\nprogram after the first semester of their junior year. Qualifying students are normally accepted into the program in\nthe second semester of the junior year.\n \nTo apply for admission, students will first consult with the Dean\u2019s Office of Undergraduate Education (350 Buttrick\nHall), and then submit to the prospective graduate department or program a \u201cPetition to Apply to the Combined\nB.A./M.A. (4+1) Degree Program\u201d (available at as.vanderbilt.edu/academics/specialdegree/4plus1.php), a statement\nof purpose, a formal application to the Graduate School, a preliminary program proposal, two letters of\nrecommendation from Vanderbilt faculty, and a current transcript. Application forms are available for download or\ncan be completed online at vanderbilt.edu/gradschool. GRE scores or other admissions requirements may be\nspecified by the prospective department. Admission to the 4+1 option is highly selective. An accomplished\nacademic record, a demonstrated commitment to pursue graduate study, and a strong endorsement from\nVanderbilt faculty are key elements to the successful applicant. Students will be provisionally accepted as graduate\nstudents, pending completion of all undergraduate requirements. Graduate student status will apply in the fifth\nyear.\n \nAdvising\nProspective students should discuss with one of their advisers general information on the program and whether this\nprogram is appropriate to their long-term goals. All students are encouraged to discuss their plans and goals with\ntheir undergraduate pre-major and major adviser. Especially in cases where the intended graduate program differs\nfrom the undergraduate major, the student is further encouraged to seek advice from the advisers in the graduate\nprogram.\n \nCurriculum\nStudents in a 4+1 program must satisfy all requirements for both degrees. Advanced Placement (AP) credits will\noften be used toward satisfying general curriculum requirements, for a maximum of 18 credit hours. The principal\ndistinction between this program and the standard graduate program is two-fold: (1) students are allowed to take\nmaster\u2019s courses while completing the bachelor\u2019s degree, and (2) students are thereby enabled to complete both\ndegrees within five years.\n \nIn order to complete the program in five years, students will be expected to complete most, if not all, of the\nrequirements for their undergraduate degree by the end of the first semester of the senior year. Until all\nbaccalaureate requirements are fulfilled, the student will follow College of Arts and Science undergraduate policies\nand procedures. It is also suggested that students begin taking graduate courses toward the master\u2019s degree in the\nsecond semester of the senior year. Most graduate programs participating in this option have a non-thesis plan of\nstudy requiring 30 graduate credit hours in addition to the requirements for the undergraduate degree. An average\nload per semester as a graduate student is 9\u201312 credit hours.\n \nScholarships and Financial Aid\nStudents who are receiving scholarships or other forms of financial aid as a Vanderbilt undergraduate are advised\nthat such aid applies in most cases only toward the completion of the bachelor\u2019s degree or the first four years of\ntheir studies (which may include their taking some graduate courses during their senior year).

It offers\noutstanding undergraduate HOD majors an opportunity to become involved in research teams with professors and\ngraduate students. The program will help students develop skills in empirical research methods, writing, and\npresentation to provide a firm foundation for advanced graduate or professional training. The HOD Honors Programs\nrequires a serious time commitment to a research project.\n \nApplication: Students may apply for the honors program at any time from the second semester of their sophomore\nyear to the summer before their senior year. The application must be approved by the faculty member with whom\nthe student will work, and will outline the nature of the research project, which will ordinarily be an extension of the\nfaculty member\u2019s ongoing research. Students must have completed HOD 1250, HOD 1300, HOD 2100, HOD 2500,\nand a college statistics course and have an overall GPA of at least 3.6. This minimum GPA must be maintained to\ngraduate with honors.\n \nApplications will be evaluated by the HOD Honors Director, who will decide on admission, taking into consideration\nthe numbers of applicants.\n \nRequirements: Upon admission students will complete two (not necessarily back-to-back) semesters of honors\nseminar (for six total hours of credit), which satisfy one course in two HOD domains of the student's choosing, plus\nthe writing course requirement.

The curriculum, which provides\nmaximum flexibility for each student, requires a minimum of 30 hours (33 hours for composition majors), satisfied\nthrough required categories as noted below. Students electing a second major outside of music complete only the\nBlair liberal arts core; they are not expected to fulfill the core requirements (such as AXLE) of another Vanderbilt\nschool or college. Hours earned toward the Blair liberal arts core may also be counted toward a second major or\nminor, if appropriate. Students admitted with a deficiency relative to high school credits must plan their liberal arts\nwork to overcome the deficiency. 1001 courses do not count for liberal arts core credit.\nEnglish/writing (6 hours)\nStudents must complete writing course MUSL 2200W during the first year.

MS 1510\nImmersion\nImmersion Vanderbilt (vanderbilt.edu/immersion) allows students to pursue a multi-year path to be curious, to\ndevelop their passions and to learn by experience. To fulfill the university requirement of Immersion Vanderbilt, a\nstudent must participate in immersive experiences and then complete a culminating project that is based on one\nspecific immersive experience as described in the Special Programs for Undergraduates section near the start of this\ncatalog.\nThe experiential learning may focus on one or more areas of student interest. Most engineering students will take\nadvantage of a four-year engineering design experience to satisfy the requirements of Immersion Vanderbilt. Each\nengineering major offers such a multi-year experience within its curriculum. Students whose plans include\nprofessional development may also pursue industrial internships. A research path can engage the student in\ndiscovery through research in engineering or other fields. While most engineering students will select an immersion\nexperience associated with their major, students can pursue an Immersion plan outside their home program. For\nexample, students interested in creative expression might develop a performance piece, exhibit, or artistic work,\nwhile those interested in international study may explore firsthand the culture, language, and history of other\ncountries. Students interested in such immersion plans should consult the Office of Experiential Learning and\nImmersion (EL&IV).\n \nThe Immersion Vanderbilt process is composed of several phases. Senior design projects in the School of\nEngineering satisfy the final project requirement for Immersion Vanderbilt, with students presenting the results of\ntheir design project at the school's Design Day or Computer Science Immersion Showcase. For students completing\nother immersion projects, the Office of Experiential Learning and Immersion Vanderbilt coordinates a series of\nshowcases open to the entire campus where students display their projects. Upon completion of the project, Office\nof Experiential Learning and Immersion Vanderbilt conveys that the requirements have been met by showing\ncompletion of the Immersion Vanderbilt graduation requirement on the student's degree audit.\nOpen Electives\nCourses taken beyond specified courses and restricted (such as program, technical, and liberal arts) electives for the\nmajor may be taken as open electives.\nOfficer Education\nCourse offerings in military science and naval science are described in the section on Special Programs for\nPage 176 of 1019",

Students\ncompleting  this program earn the bachelor of music (B.Mus.) majoring in the integrated studies/teacher education\ntrack for four years, and the master of education (M.Ed.) in the fifth year to complete professional education\nrequirements. During the junior year, application is made to Peabody College. The M.Ed. work requires one calendar\nyear, June\u2013May. Students may elect to work toward licensure in either instrumental/general or vocal/general music,\nbased on their interest and ability to perform at a level sufficient for placement in the appropriate performing\nensemble. The curriculum includes a strong   music performance emphasis; a solid foundation in\nmusicology/ethnomusicology, theory, and the liberal arts; undergraduate and graduate courses in psychology and\neducation; and practica (practical experience) four of the five years of study, with at least 15 weeks of student\nteaching in field placements. Practica constitute a wide variety of grade K-12 experiences, including public school,\nprivate school, and Blair Academy programs such as Suzuki strings, Blair Children\u2019s Chorus program, and the\nNashville Youth Orchestra program. Students complete the same music core requirements as any other B.Mus.\ncandidate.

    "Engineering Education in a University Setting": "Facilities\nProfessional Registration and Accreditation\nEmployment of Graduates\nSupporting Organizations\n \nVanderbilt University School of Engineering is the largest and oldest private engineering school in the South. Classes\noffering engineering instruction began in 1879, and seven years later Engineering was made a separate unit with its\nPage 170 of 1019\nown dean. The school\u2019s program emphasizes the relationship of the engineering profession to society and prepares\nengineers to be socially aware as well as technically competent.\n \nThe mission of the School of Engineering is threefold: to produce intellectual leaders, entrepreneurs, and innovators\nby recruiting the best students and providing them a top-notch education; to deliver scholarship of the highest\ncaliber, published in the most visible venues, addressing important societal problems; and to be a leader in\nentrepreneurship and innovation, in Tennessee, the U.S., and globally.\n \nThe school strives to meet the undergraduate education portion of its mission by offering degree programs in fields\nof engineering relevant to the needs of society. An objective of these programs is to provide a technical education\nintegrated with strong humanities, fine arts, and social sciences subject matter to provide the requisite foundation\nfor lifelong learning. The availability of second majors and minors in subject areas in other schools and colleges of\nthe university increases opportunities for engineering students to enhance their education by pursuing studies in\nthe non-technical disciplines. Engineering students take close to 50 percent of their courses outside of the School of\nEngineering and associate daily with peers from other schools and colleges within the university.\n \nAnother objective is to prepare students who intend to enter engineering practice upon graduation and those who\nwill continue their studies at the graduate level in engineering or in other professional fields. To this end, our\nprograms emphasize mathematics and engineering sciences with significant exposure to engineering design and\nhands-on laboratory experiences.\n \nA large fraction of the student body is destined for management positions early in their working careers. To meet\nthese students\u2019 needs, the Engineering Management program offers a well-integrated minor.\n \nStudents at all levels have the opportunity to work with faculty in the generation of new knowledge. Those planning\nfor graduate studies and research are especially encouraged to participate in individual topics and research courses\nto fulfill that desire. Engineering students also participate in summer research programs of the university and of the\nschool.\n \nFacilities\nThe School of Engineering is housed in five main buildings with several satellite facilities. William W. Featheringill\nHall houses a three-story atrium designed for student interaction and social events, more than fifty teaching and\nresearch laboratories with the latest equipment and computer resources, and project rooms. The Engineering and\nScience Building is an eight-story state-of-the-art building that houses the Wond'ry at the Innovation Pavilion, the\nFrist Center for Autism and Innovation, numerous research labs, interactive classrooms, clean rooms, and space for\nstudents to work, study, and socialize. Olin Hall, which is attached to the Engineering and Science building, houses\nChemical and Biomolecular Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, and Materials Science, several classrooms, and\nresearch and teaching laboratories. School administrative offices and several classrooms are located on the ground\nfloor of the Science and Engineering Building in Stevenson Center, which also houses the Biomedical Engineering\ndepartment on the 8th and 9th floors. Jacobs Hall, which flanks Featheringill Hall, contains laboratories, offices, and\nclassrooms serving the Civil and Environmental Engineering, and Electrical and Computer Engineering departments.\nLabs, offices, and meeting spaces for Computer Science are also housed at 17th & DeFord Bailey, a building that\nserves as a hub for Computer Science and Data Science. Several satellite facilities are also part of the Engineering\nSchool: the W. M. Keck Free-Electron Laser Center building, housing the labs and offices of the Biomedical Photonics\nCenter; the Laboratory for Systems Integrity and Reliability (LASIR), an off-campus hangar-style facility dedicated to\nscaling up experiments to realistic and full size that houses a wind tunnel and military aircraft; the Vanderbilt\nInstitute of Software Integrated Systems; and the Institute for Space and Defense Electronics.\n \nIn all its engineering programs, Vanderbilt recognizes the vital place of experimental and research laboratories in\nthe learning experience. Laboratories are designed to provide the strongest personal contact between students and\nfaculty members consistent with enrollment.\nPage 171 of 1019",
    "Professional Registration and Accreditation": "Legislation exists in the various states requiring registration of all engineers who contract with the public to perform\nprofessional work. Although many engineering positions do not require professional certification, Vanderbilt\nsupports registration and encourages its graduates to take the Fundamentals of Engineering examination as soon as\nthey become eligible.\n \nBachelor of engineering degrees in biomedical engineering, chemical engineering, civil engineering, electrical and\ncomputer engineering, and mechanical engineering are accredited as noted below. Students in these programs may\ntake the Fundamentals of Engineering examination as seniors. In addition, proven professional experience is a\nrequirement for registration. Some state boards may have additional requirements for licensure.\n \nAll programs leading to the Bachelor of Engineering degree and the program leading to the Bachelor of Science in\ncomputer science are accredited as follows:\n \nThe Bachelor of Engineering degree program in biomedical engineering is accredited by the Engineering\nAccreditation Commission of ABET, https://www.abet.org/, under the General Criteria and the Program Criteria for\nBioengineering and Biomedical and Similarly Named Engineering Programs.\n \nThe Bachelor of Engineering degree program in civil engineering is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation\nCommission of ABET, https://www.abet.org/, under the General Criteria and the Program Criteria for Civil and\nSimilarly Named Engineering Programs.\n \nThe Bachelor of Engineering degree program in chemical engineering is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation\nCommission of ABET, https://www.abet.org/, under the General Criteria and the Program Criteria for Chemical,\nBiochemical, Biomolecular and Similarly Named Engineering Programs.\n \nThe Bachelor of Science program in computer science is accredited by the Computing Accreditation Commission of\nABET, https://www.abet.org/, under the General Criteria and Program Criteria for Computer Science and Similarly\nNamed Computing Programs. The accredited program in computer science is the primary major administered by the\nSchool of Engineering. Computer science added as a second major by students outside the School of Engineering is\nnot an accredited program.\n \nThe Bachelor of Engineering degree program in electrical and computer engineering is accredited by the\nEngineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, https://www.abet.org/, under the General Criteria and the Program\nCriteria for Electrical, Computer, Communications, Telecommunication(s) and Similarly Named Engineering\nPrograms.\n \nThe Bachelor of Engineering degree program in mechanical engineering is accredited by the the Engineering\nAccreditation Commission of ABET, https://www.abet.org/, under the General Criteria and the Program Criteria for\nPage 172 of 1019\nMechanical and Similarly Named Engineering Programs.\nEmployment of Graduates\nOf the recent Vanderbilt graduates with baccalaureate degrees in engineering, about 75 percent entered directly\ninto professional practice. Twenty-five percent continued with graduate or professional education. Others pursued\ndiverse careers or other interests. Additional information regarding the employment of engineering graduates is\navailable on the School of Engineering's website and in the VU Career Center.\nSupporting Organizations\nVanderbilt Engineering Council\nThe Engineering Council is a student organization whose main goal is facilitating community among undergraduate\nstudents in the School of Engineering by organizing activities, e.g., Engineering Week, de-stress events around final\nexaminations, and many more. Additionally, the council acts as a student voice to school administration and faculty.\nRepresentatives of engineering student organizations apply to serve on the E-Council leadership team, and the\ncurrent leadership board selects and trains the new members. While the council has no administrative power, it\nprovides students with a voice in the decision- making process in the School of Engineering.\nProfessional Societies\nThe leading national engineering societies have chartered branches or student sections at Vanderbilt.

This designation appears on their diplomas.\nStudy Abroad\nVanderbilt's Global Education Office offers approximately thirty programs that allow students to take engineering or\ncomputer science courses in English abroad, in locations ranging from Dublin to Sydney, Madrid to Hong Kong.\nThere are no language prerequisites for these programs. These programs also allow students to take a range of\nliberal arts core, major core, and elective courses abroad. In no case, after matriculating at Vanderbilt, may a\nstudent participate in a Vanderbilt-approved study abroad program through a different university or through an\nexternal agency and then seek to transfer that credit into Vanderbilt. Financial aid can be used for study abroad\nduring the academic year, and scholarships are available to support Vanderbilt-approved summer study abroad\noptions. Students are encouraged to discuss with their academic advisers how best to incorporate study abroad into\ntheir four-year plans of study. All students who study abroad must register their travel in advance with Vanderbilt\u2019s\ninternational security provider.\n \nRegistration is completed on your behalf when enrolling in a program offered through the Global Education Office.\nOtherwise, information is available on the GlobalVU website: vanderbilt.edu/global.\nTeacher Education\nStudents who are interested in preparing for licensure as secondary school teachers should plan their programs in\nconsultation with the associate dean in the School of Engineering and the Director of Secondary Education in the\nDepartment of Teaching and Learning at Peabody College. More specific information on professional education\ncourse requirements can be found under the Licensure for Teaching chapter in the Peabody College section of this\ncatalog.

This designation appears on their diplomas.\nStudy Abroad\nVanderbilt's Global Education Office offers approximately thirty programs that allow students to take engineering or\ncomputer science courses in English abroad, in locations ranging from Dublin to Sydney, Madrid to Hong Kong.\nThere are no language prerequisites for these programs. These programs also allow students to take a range of\nliberal arts core, major core, and elective courses abroad. In no case, after matriculating at Vanderbilt, may a\nstudent participate in a Vanderbilt-approved study abroad program through a different university or through an\nexternal agency and then seek to transfer that credit into Vanderbilt. Financial aid can be used for study abroad\nduring the academic year, and scholarships are available to support Vanderbilt-approved summer study abroad\noptions. Students are encouraged to discuss with their academic advisers how best to incorporate study abroad into\ntheir four-year plans of study. All students who study abroad must register their travel in advance with Vanderbilt\u2019s\ninternational security provider.\n \nRegistration is completed on your behalf when enrolling in a program offered through the Global Education Office.\nOtherwise, information is available on the GlobalVU website: vanderbilt.edu/global.\nTeacher Education\nStudents who are interested in preparing for licensure as secondary school teachers should plan their programs in\nconsultation with the associate dean in the School of Engineering and the Director of Secondary Education in the\nDepartment of Teaching and Learning at Peabody College. More specific information on professional education\ncourse requirements can be found under the Licensure for Teaching chapter in the Peabody College section of this\ncatalog. Inquiries can also be made to the Office of Teacher Licensure at Peabody.\nSecond Major\nIt is possible for a student to combine an engineering field with a second area outside the School of Engineering.\nThe student must obtain prior approval of each department and satisfy the requirements of each major, including\nthe requirement regarding minimum grade point average. Students in the School of Engineering may use courses\noutside the School of Engineering for relevant second majors even if those courses also fulfill a degree requirement.\n \nCertain double majors involving two programs within the School of Engineering have been approved by the faculty.\nThe approved double majors are biomedical engineering/electrical and computer engineering, and biomedical\nengineering/chemical engineering.\nPage 178 of 1019",

CSET is ideal as\na second major for students pursuing a first major in one of the natural sciences, any of several of the social\nsciences, engineering, the Science, Medicine and Technology concentration in History, and the Creative Writing track\nin English. In the twenty-first century scientists must be able to communicate their work and their ideas to their\nprofessional peers, to nonspecialists who review grant proposals, and to lay audiences who ultimately fund,\nsupport, and benefit from the discoveries made in laboratories around the world. In return, the scientific community\nneeds support from professional writers, journalists, technical writing specialists, public speakers, film and video\nwriters and producers, and bloggers in communicating modern science, technology, and medicine to lay audiences.\nProgram of Concentration in Communication of Science and Technology\nTrack 1: Standard track [at least 42 credit hours] \n1.

Many of the barriers to widespread\nincorporation of alternate and renewable energy, from higher-capacity, more robust, less expensive batteries for\nenergy storage, to high efficiency/low cost solar devices, involve the need for new materials. Materials will play an\never-increasing role in health care. New medical devices, drug delivery systems, and synthetic biological tissue are\njust a few of the health-related applications in need of new materials for their success. In addition, materials\nchallenges are front and center in the ever-evolving areas of electronic devices. Engineers and scientists with\nknowledge of materials science and engineering concepts are needed to address these and many more materials\nchallenges.\n \nMaterials science and engineering is an interdisciplinary program with affiliated faculty from all engineering\ndisciplines, as well as faculty from chemistry, and physics. Two undergraduate options involving materials science\nand engineering are available. Students pursuing a B.S. in engineering science may choose a program concentration\nin materials science and engineering. This option requires the student to take MSE 1500, 1500L, and 2500, and\nother materials science and engineering elective courses to complete their 24 hours of engineering program\nelectives. Students pursuing a B.E. in an engineering discipline can earn a minor in materials science and\nengineering.\n \nThe minor in materials science and engineering provides the student with an understanding of engineering\nmaterials. It complements and adds to the student\u2019s major in one of the engineering disciplines, exposing the\nstudent to an interdisciplinary approach to problem solving.

Religion has always been\nactive in human affairs for good and for ill, encompassing histories, literatures, politics, cosmologies, and medicines.\nUnderstanding the diversity of religious traditions on their own terms is vital for accuracy in approaching the world's\nmany challenges. The faculty of Vanderbilt's Religious Studies Department and our many affiliated faculty across\nthe university provide expertise and research in a variety of religious traditions. In addition to our expertise in\nspecific religious cultures, texts, practices, rituals, and histories, we also share research interests and teaching focus\non the religious dimensions of race and caste, colonialism, gender and sexuality, health and healing, and the climate\ncrisis.\n \nStudents majoring in religious studies gain a deep knowledge of a single tradition, region, or theme and a broad\nunderstanding of religions around the world. Successful students develop a highly portable analytical skill set that\nequips them to pursue graduate degrees in religion or cognate disciplines, as well as professional degrees and\ncareers in fields such as law, diplomacy, medicine, and business. It also provides an excellent second major for a\nvariety of disciplines that address the human condition including neuroscience; sociology; history; medicine, health,\nPage 457 of 1019",

The minor is administered by the School of Engineering. Students who complete this minor\nwill have a toolkit that includes programming skills useful for simulating physical, biological, and social dynamics, as\nwell as an understanding of how to take advantage of modern software tools to extract meaningful information from\nsmall and large datasets.\n \nComputation is now an integral part of modern science and engineering. In science, computer simulation allows the\nstudy of natural phenomena impossible or intractable through experimental means. In engineering, computer\nsimulation allows the analysis and synthesis of systems too expensive, dangerous, or complex to model and build\ndirectly. Astronomers studying the formation of massive black holes, neuroscientists studying neural networks for\nhuman memory, mechanical engineers studying the designs of turbines and compressors, and electrical engineers\nstudying the reliability of electronics aboard spacecraft are united both in the computational challenges they face\nand the tools and techniques they use to solve these challenges.\n \nStudents in the program in scientific computing are taught techniques for understanding such complex physical,\nbiological, and also social systems. Students are introduced to computational methods for simulating and analyzing\nmodels of complex systems, to scientific visualization and data mining techniques needed to detect structure in\nmassively large multidimensional data sets, to high performance computing techniques for simulating models on\ncomputing clusters with hundreds or thousands of parallel, independent processors and for analyzing terabytes or\nmore of data that may be distributed across a massive cloud or grid storage environment.\n \nScientific computing at Vanderbilt is supported by faculty and includes students from a wide range of scientific and\nPage 235 of 1019\nengineering disciplines. While the content domain varies, these disciplines often require similar computational\napproaches, high-performance computing resources, and skills to simulate interactions, model real-life systems, and\ntest competing hypotheses. Scientific computing embodies the computational tools and techniques for solving many\nof the grand challenges facing science and engineering today.\n \nThe minor in scientific computing prepares students for advanced coursework that combines computational\napproaches with a substantive area of science or engineering. It prepares students for independent study with a\nfaculty member on a research project. It prepares students for advanced study in graduate school. It provides skills\nthat will be attractive to many employers after graduation.\n \nThe minor in scientific computing is distinct from the minor in computer science. Scientific computing uses\ncomputation as a tool to solve scientific and engineering problems in research and application. It is more focused on\nsimulation, numerical techniques, high performance computing, and higher-level methods than the minor in\ncomputer science, which is focused on the algorithms, systems, and technologies that enable such methods to be\ndeveloped and employed.\n \nThe minor in scientific computing requires 15 credit hours, distributed as follows:\n \n1.

    "Education and Human Development at Vanderbilt": "George Peabody College for Teachers, recognized for more than a century as one of the foremost independent\ncolleges of teacher education, merged with Vanderbilt University in the summer of 1979 to become Vanderbilt\nUniversity\u2019s Peabody College of education and human development. Since then, Peabody College has retained its\nheritage while achieving new stature as a place where world-class research is conducted and translated into\nteaching, practice, policy, and service. Peabody's mission is characterized by practice-oriented academic programs,\na strong service ethic, groundbreaking research, and a pressing concern for addressing social problems in domestic\nand international contexts.\n \nThe college\u2019s faculty and students constitute a vibrant intellectual community answering pressing questions and\nexpanding knowledge about PreK\u201312 and higher education, including special education; psychology, especially\nfocused on families and children; the development of individuals and organizations; and educational administration,\nleadership, and policy. Peabody College understands the preparation of researchers, teachers, and leaders as\namong the most important things it does, and that building and sustaining an engaged academic community of\nlearners is central to achieving its mission.\n \nPeabody faculty and students engage in a broad spectrum of basic and applied research to generate new\nknowledge and translate that knowledge into practice. Current research findings inform classroom teaching at\nPeabody in every program. Moreover, Peabody faculty bring an interdisciplinary and entrepreneurial spirit to the\nresearch enterprise.\n \nWorking collaboratively, often through one of the college\u2019s research centers, faculty and students publish and\npresent their findings, apply them in real-world settings, and help to shape public debate about the nature and\nfuture of education and human development.\n \nThe college is devoted to enhancing opportunity in an increasingly diverse society. More than 1,900 students are\nenrolled at Peabody, with more than one-third of them in post-baccalaureate graduate or professional degree\nprograms.\n \nAll teacher education programs are accredited by the Council for the Accreditation of Education Preparation (CAEP).\nCounseling programs are accredited by the Council for the Accreditation of Counseling and Related Education\nPrograms (CACREP).\nCenters and Outreach Efforts\nFor more information about Peabody College's Centers and Outreach Efforts, please see here:\nhttps://peabody.vanderbilt.edu/research/research-centers.\nNext Steps at Vanderbilt University\nNext Steps at Vanderbilt is a four-year, nonresidential certification program for students with intellectual and\ndevelopmental disabilities, providing individualized programs of study in the areas of education, social skills, and\nvocational training.

Peabody also provides professional education courses for College of Arts and Science\nstudents who want to prepare for teacher licensure.\n \nThe bachelor of science is granted on the basis of 120 semester hours of college work with a final grade point\naverage of 2.000, and completion of the Liberal Education Core and the requirements of the major.\nLiberal Education Core Program\nIn pursuit of breadth of knowledge and understanding about the world in which they live, all undergraduates\ncomplete the requirements of the Liberal Education Core program. This Liberal Education Core component of all\nPeabody undergraduate majors is intended to provide students with a solid foundation in the arts and sciences. The\ncore curriculum incorporates the study of human conditions that are universal. The Liberal Education Core involves\nstudy in the following areas:\n \nCommunications. The study of language in its written and spoken forms.\nMathematics/Quantitative Analysis. The study of mathematical concepts and procedures.\nSocial Sciences. The study of the past\u2014both the heritage of the United States and the more global human story.\nHumanities. The study of the universal language of the arts.\nNatural Sciences. The study of scientific process and interrelationships among the sciences.\n \nThrough the study of these universal subjects, concepts, and modes of thought, students gain a broad foundation\ntransferable to their futures. They will continue to grow within society and the classroom and will look at problems\nfrom different perspectives while maintaining curiosity.\n \nCourses identified to fulfill the Liberal Education Core requirement for each undergraduate major are listed in\nPeabody\u2019s Undergraduate Handbook (https://peabody.vanderbilt.edu/office-academic-services/). \n \nCourses used to satisfy these core requirements may also be counted toward the fulfillment of requirements in an\nacademic major. Special topics courses are ordinarily not acceptable for meeting Liberal Education Core\nrequirements. These courses require prior approval as substitute courses. Independent study courses are not\nacceptable for meeting Liberal Education Core requirements.\n \nTransfer students may use credits from other colleges to fulfill Peabody\u2019s Liberal Education Core requirements if the\ncredits are equivalent to the courses offered at Vanderbilt. For transfer students, credits are evaluated when the\nstudent enrolls at Peabody in order to determine which transfer courses will substitute for Peabody\u2019s Liberal\nEducation Core requirements.

The major is designed to provide a\nstrong background in the social and behavioral sciences related to child development, a focused understanding of\nthe scientific study of children and the contexts in which they develop, and opportunities for supervised and\nindependent research on aspects of child development in ways that enable students to link theories and prior\nresearch to research design and data on children\u2019s development. The major is excellent preparation for graduate\nstudy in selected social science and professional fields (e.g., psychology, medicine, nursing, education, public\npolicy) and offers an excellent complementary (or second) major for undergraduate students simultaneously\npursuing a major in cognitive studies, elementary education, human and organizational development, or special\neducation.\n \nThe child development curriculum is designed to ensure that students develop a background in the liberal arts and\nsciences; a clear understanding of the theories, major research findings, and research methods central to the field of\nchild development; and an area of focus or expertise in child development. Development of background in the\nliberal arts and sciences occurs within the context of the Liberal Education Core, composed of required and elective\ncourses in communications, humanities, mathematics, natural sciences, and social sciences. A clear understanding\nof theory and research central to the field is developed through the major core courses. These include an overview\nof child development, courses focused on the domains of psychological processes central to human development\n(cognition; social and personality development), courses related to major epochs of child development (infancy and\nadolescence), and courses devoted to the major research methodologies in the field (experimental, observational,\npsychometric).

Professional core courses are designed to\nhelp students:\n1. Understand the basic principles and typical patterns of human development across the life span and use this\nknowledge to understand their own behavior and the behavior of others;\n2. Understand the principles of group dynamics and use this knowledge to provide leadership and facilitate\ndecision making in small group and team settings;\n3. Understand theories of organizations and apply them to the solution of organizational problems;\n4. Understand the critical role that community contexts play in shaping individual, group, and organizational\nwell-being;\n5. Apply quantitative and qualitative methods of systematic inquiry and analysis;\n6. Understand public policy processes and the factors that influence policy making;\n7. Understand the ethical dimensions of personal and organizational decisions and apply this understanding to\nanalyze social issues and make professional and personal decisions;\n8. Develop enhanced skills of synthesis including the ability to integrate ideas from various sources and to\ndesign innovative programs.\n9. Understand and engage in practices and policies that ensure inclusion of diverse populations and\nperspectives.\nThe program design will endow you with the skills and knowledge needed to succeed in a people-oriented\norganizational role.\n \nHuman and Organizational Development Domains: Domain courses build on the foundational courses in the HOD\nProfessional Core. Students will choose courses that will help them develop breadth and depth across levels of\nanalysis in topic areas of interest. Students must complete two courses in each of the following three domains:\n \n   Individual/Interpersonal Domain: Courses in this domain delve deeper into personal and professional development\nand explore topics, including but not limited to, leadership, professional ethics, youth development, professional\n   development, and mental health and well-being. Through these courses students will develop professional skills in\ndata management, research, individual and team leadership, human-centered design, and interpersonal conflict\nresolution.\n \n   Organizational/Group Domain: Courses in this domain explore recent advances in organizational theory and\ninnovative management strategies in for-profit, non-profit, and public sector organizations in the U.S. and\ninternational contexts.    Course topics include, but are not limited to organizational effectiveness, organizational\nchange management, and social entrepreneurship. Courses use case studies and practical application to prepare\nstudents to engage organizational    challenges in an increasingly complex and dynamic world.\n \n   Community/Policy Domain: Courses in this domain invite students to critically examine the causes and\nconsequences of complex social problems from a systems perspective and explore community- and policy-level\napproaches to change    and intervention. Courses address a range of local and global topics and consider the\ndiverse perspectives of marginalized communities. These topics include, but are not limited to educational equity,\nenvironmental justice and    sustainability, violence prevention, and economic development, as well as  poverty-\nrelated challenges such as fair and affordable housing, employment, health disparities, transportation,\nneighborhood safety, and resource provision.\n \nHuman and Organizational Development Capstone: (12 credit hours/Summer or 15 credit hours/Fall or Spring\nPage 275 of 1019\nsemesters): The Capstone is the immersive learning academic semester for junior and senior students in the Human\nand Organizational Development (HOD) major at Vanderbilt University. Successful completion of the HOD Capstone\nsemester satisfies the Vanderbilt Immersion requirement. The Capstone is designed for students to apply the core\nHOD coursework and develop data-driven and research-grounded contributions to address human problems in\norganizations and communities. The HOD capstone requires 28 hours a week, at least 30% in person, fully in person\npreferred with the confirmed site and a weekly 3-hour seminar. The experience is possible in fall, spring or summer\nsemesters. The HOD Capstone office has preexisting relationships with sites in Nashville, Chicago, New York City,\nSan Francisco, Washington D.C. and London, England. However, students are not limited to these cities.\n \nThe HOD philosophy emphasizes the importance of connecting academic knowledge and theories to professional\npractice. HOD undergraduate core requirements offer an applied liberal arts education that will endow students with\nthe skills and knowledge needed to succeed in organizations and communities. The capstone semester is designed\nto provide students the opportunity to synthesize the HOD coursework and learning experiences in an\norganizational context - which is central to the foundation of the applied learning experience and mission of our\ndegree.\nHOD majors (juniors and seniors) who have successfully completed the HOD 4949 Capstone Design requirements,\napproved for the HOD Capstone by the HOD Capstone Office, and completed the HOD core class prerequisites\nincluding HOD 1250, 1300, 2100, 2400 (not required for students who entered Summer 2023 or later), 2500, and\n2700 are eligible to register for HOD 4950, 4951, 4952 and 4953.\n \nStudents enroll in a semester-long course, HOD 4949 in the fall to design a spring capstone and enroll in\nspring to design a summer or fall capstone. Note HOD 4949 Capstone Design is not offered in the\nsummer. The capstone design semester is an opportunity for students to explore, develop and confirm a successful\ncapstone experience. They partner with the HOD Capstone team for mentoring, coaching, connection events, and a\nvariety of campus partners to confirm their capstone site. The capstone semester provides a variety of opportunities\nfor students to integrate and apply earlier coursework in a civic/professional, research, international or creative\npartnership. Students design their capstone to align with their field of interest. They select opportunities that\nprovide valuable applied work experiences, build professional development competencies, and help launch their\npost-graduation careers. During the HOD capstone semester, students enroll in four courses that accompany their\ncapstone experience: HOD 4950 (P/F - 3 credit hours during summer; 6 hours during fall or spring) Organizational\nPartnership, HOD 4951 (3 hours) Critical Reflexivity and Systems Thinking, HOD 4952 (3 hours) Mapping Future\nDevelopment, and HOD 4953 (3 hours) Analysis and Contribution.

To meet the challenge of providing training for entry into this exciting and growing field, Vanderbilt\noffers an interdisciplinary program of concentration in neuroscience that utilizes expertise from several departments\nwithin  the university. The program consists of three components. The first provides for a broad foundation in the\nbasic sciences and mathematics. Second, the program provides for exposure to each of the general areas of\nneuroscience including courses in cellular/molecular, systems, and integrative/cognitive neuroscience. This course\nwork is supplemented with exposure to the laboratory techniques utilized in neuroscience research. Finally, the\nprogram allows students to pursue more work in the specific sub-disciplines of neuroscience and in areas of inquiry\nrelated to neuroscience through elective courses. Students are especially encouraged to participate in research in\nthe laboratories of neuroscience faculty under the auspices of the undergraduate research courses. More extensive\nresearch experience  is available through the Honors Program in Neuroscience. For additional information, see\nas.vanderbilt.edu/neuroscience.\nProgram of Concentration\nThe neuroscience major consists of 38 credit hours of course work that includes 8 credit hours of organic chemistry\nand 30 credit hours of neuroscience and related courses distributed among specific disciplines associated with the\nstudy of neuroscience. Students majoring in neuroscience are additionally required to complete a core of\nintroductory courses in mathematics, statistics or computer science, biology and physics that provide the broad\nscientific background necessary to the study of neuroscience. The areas and associated course options are listed\nbelow. Excluding research credit (3861, 3862, 3863, 3864, and 4999), the neuroscience and related courses must be\ndrawn from at least two departments or programs.\n \nStudents seeking a second major within the College of Arts and Science may count a maximum of 6 credit hours of\n2000-or-higher-level course work to meet the requirements of both majors.\nRequired Math and Science Courses\nBiological Sciences (8 credit hours)\nBSCI 1510, 1511, 1510L, and either 1511L or 1512L.\nPage 437 of 1019",

    "Program of Concentration in Chemistry": "The chemistry program is organized into four parts. The first part is a general chemistry course sequence (CHEM\n1601\u20131602 and 1601L\u20131602L or AP credit) to serve as an entry point into the major. The second part consists of\nfoundation courses in the five major disciplines of chemistry: analytical (2100), biochemistry (BSCI 2520), inorganic\n(3010), organic (2221\u20132222 or 2211\u20132212), and physical (3300 or 3310). The third part of the chemistry major\nconsists of completing 8 credit hours of laboratory past 1601L\u20131602L. Four credit hours are from laboratory courses\n(2221L\u20132222L, 2100L, and 3315) associated with foundation courses. There are also 6 credit hours of a capstone\nlaboratory (4965\u20134966) designed to provide advanced laboratory experience. The fourth part of the major consists\nof completing a minimum of 6 credit hours of in-depth chemistry courses. These in-depth courses build upon the\ncontent of foundation courses or integrate concepts from these foundational disciplines.\n \nRequired Non-chemistry Courses\nPage 323 of 1019\nOne year of calculus (MATH 1300-1301 is preferred)\nPHYS: Both 1501\u20131502 and 1501L\u20131502L, or both 1601\u20131602 and 1601L\u20131602L, or 1901\u20131902\n \nRequired Chemistry Courses\nCr.

    "Climate and Environmental Studies": ")\n \nCOURSES OFFERED: ENVS\n \nHuman beings and their societies necessarily interact with and alter the Earth\u2019s natural environment. Climate and\nEnvironmental Studies (CES) is home to two interdisciplinary undergraduate programs. Both the Climate Studies\nmajor (CLIM) and the Environmental and Sustainability Studies (ESS) minor allow the student to examine human\ninteraction with the environment by concentrating on methods in the natural sciences, humanities and social\nsciences with some experience in the other areas of study as well as environmental engineering and social\nengagement. The major, in particular, is designed to provide students with a strong foundation in the full range of\ndisciplinary perspectives across the humanities, natural sciences and social sciences.\n \nProgram of Concentration (I) in Climate Studies\n \nThe major requires 30 credit hours. Some of the courses require prerequisites, and students are responsible for\nmeeting those prerequisites if they choose to satisfy the major with those classes.\n \n1. Climate Studies introduction: ENVS 1101\n2. Climate science foundation: EES 2110 or EES 3310\n3. Core humanities course.

Two courses from the following: ANTH 2400, 3120, 3125, 3261; BME 2400; CE\n3300; CMST 1501, 3800; CSET 2100, 3257; CS 1000; 2204, DHUM 1100, 1200; DS 1000, 1100, 2100, 3100;\nECON 1500, 1510, 3035; HART 1740W, 2815; HIST 1515; HODC 3222; MATH 1010, 1100, 1201, 1301, 2810,\n2821; PSY 2100, PSY-PC 2120; SOC 2100, 3002\n7. Specialization electives: 9 credit hours. See the director of undergraduate studies for recommended\nconcentration clusters. The nine additional credit hours may come from any of the courses listed above for\n#3, 4, and 5. They may also include the following additional courses: ANTH 2109, 2150, 2220W, 3138, 3202,\n3333W, 4154; ASIA 2306, 2309W; BSCI 1511, 2238, 3231, 3233, EES 2150, 2309W, 2580, 3220, 3280, 3330,\n4233, 4300, 4480; ECON 2170; ENVE 3610, 4305; ENVS 4101, 4101W; CE 2120, 3300, 4300; CSET 3240W,\n3890; ENGL 2330W; 3240; HART 1740W, 2200, 3240W; HODC 3650, HODH 3650; HODI 3270; SOC 1030,\n3314, 3312, 3316, 3318, 3319, 3321; PSCI 3253, 3264W, 3265; UNIV 3315/5315\n \nProgram II: Honors Program in Climate Studies\n \nThe Honors Track offers majors in Climate Studies the opportunity to pursue intensive work through an independent\nresearch project. Students interested in pursuing the Honors Track should contact the director of undergraduate\nstudies for more information. To be considered for the Honors Track in Climate Studies, a student must have a\nminimum cumulative GPA of 3.4 and a minimum GPA of 3.6 for courses that count toward the major. Students\nshould express interest to the director of undergraduate studies before March 1 of their junior year. Students who\nare recommended for the program by the director of undergraduate studies will typically begin the program by\ntaking ENVS 4101W during the fall term of the senior year.  \nPage 338 of 1019\nThe Honors Track requires the following:\n \n1. Successful completion of requirements 1-7 in Program I, for a total of 30 credit hours. Requirements 1, 2, and 6\nmust be completed prior to beginning the honors courses.  \n \n2. Successful completion of at least two semesters of honors coursework (6 credit hours) for the Honors Track.\nStudents take ENVS 4101W or ENVS 4981 (Honors Research) during the first semester of their senior year, when\nthey develop the literature review and research plan. The first semester of honors coursework counts as part of\nrequirement 7 of Program I and can be used to fulfill the requirements for Program I should students not go on to\nfinish honors during the second semester of honors coursework.  After completing the first semester of honors\ncoursework, students then take a minimum of 3 and maximum of 6 credit hours of 4981 (Honors Research) during\nthe second semester, which is in addition to the 30 credits required to complete the standard major. Thus students\nmust take a minimum of 6 credit hours of honors coursework and may take up to 9 credit hours.\n \n3. In order to earn honors in Climate Studies, students must successfully complete, defend, and perform requested\nrevisions on the honors thesis before deadlines for graduation. Successful defense of the completed thesis is through\nan oral presentation and examination by the thesis adviser and a designated faculty reader near the end of the\nstudent's final semester. Revisions must be completed and the thesis submitted no later than the last day of\nundergraduate classes.\n \n4. Students meeting these requirements receive honors or highest honors in Climate Studies, depending on the\nquality of the thesis and performance on the defense.  Successful candidates will be recognized in the\ncommencement program and receive a Vanderbilt diploma that records honors or highest honors in Climate Studies.\n \nComprehensive Exam\nIn order to graduate with a climate studies major, students must take a comprehensive exam during their senior\nyear. The exam is not graded, and no grade will appear on the student's transcript. The purpose of the exam is to\ntest the extent to which climate studies majors are retaining core aspects of the climate & environmental studies\ncurriculum.\n \nMinor in Environmental and Sustainability Studies\n \nStudents who want to minor in environmental and sustainability studies must take a minimum of six courses (18\ncredit hours total) chosen from the courses listed below; additional relevant courses may be counted with approval\nof the director of the program. Courses must be distributed as follows: (A) one Natural Science- and Technology-\nIntensive course; (B) one Humanities course; (C) one Social-Behavioral Sciences and Policy-Intensive course; (D) two\nadditional courses from B and/or C; and (E) a capstone course. No more than two courses may be at the 1000 level.\nIn addition,  no more than 3 credit hours may be counted simultaneously toward both the environmental and\nsustainability studies minor and any other major or minor.

Ornes\n \nCOURSES OFFERED: CSET\n \nThe Program in Communication of Science and Technology (CSET) sits at the intersection of the sciences and the\nhumanities, and it builds on the vast amount of effort at Vanderbilt devoted to interdisciplinary work that spans the\nnatural sciences, engineering, the social sciences, and the humanities. CSET draws on both the scientific\ncommunities (natural sciences, social sciences, engineering, medicine) and the creative communities (public\nspeaking, writing, digital media production) across multiple colleges at Vanderbilt.\n \nCSET is designed for students who have an interest in science and technology and also are interested in\ncommunicating science and technology to both peer-professional audiences and to the larger world. CSET is ideal as\na second major for students pursuing a first major in one of the natural sciences, any of several of the social\nsciences, engineering, the Science, Medicine and Technology concentration in History, and the Creative Writing track\nin English. In the twenty-first century scientists must be able to communicate their work and their ideas to their\nprofessional peers, to nonspecialists who review grant proposals, and to lay audiences who ultimately fund,\nsupport, and benefit from the discoveries made in laboratories around the world. In return, the scientific community\nneeds support from professional writers, journalists, technical writing specialists, public speakers, film and video\nwriters and producers, and bloggers in communicating modern science, technology, and medicine to lay audiences.\nProgram of Concentration in Communication of Science and Technology\nTrack 1: Standard track [at least 42 credit hours] \n1.

    "Program of Concentration in Earth and Environmental Sciences": "The Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences offers two tracks to an EES major, to support the preparation\nof future scientists and students aimed at science-related pursuits. Both tracks provide a solid grounding in the\nintegrated Earth and environmental sciences while allowing flexibility in the particular focus and support\ncommunication, quantitative, and computational skills.\nTrack 1\nThis track is designed for students who aim to build a strong, integrated earth and environmental science foundation\nto inform discussions and work in policy, education, law, advocacy, community engagement, conservation, finance,\netc. but do not aim to work as practicing scientists. This pathway pairs well with programs in Climate and\nEnvironmental Studies, Environmental Sociology, Communication of Science and Technology, Secondary Education,\nand other non-STEM majors that, together, will prepare students for the interdisciplinary nature of addressing the\nEarth and environmental challenges of our future.\n \nTrack 1 of the EES major is organized into six parts, beginning with two of three introductory courses that serve as\nentry points. The second part involves a core course that provides all EES majors with a common background in\nways of thinking in Earth and environmental sciences. This core course must be completed before students may\nenroll in  more advanced EES courses. As Earth and Environmental sciences employ techniques and foundational\nknowledge from all other STEM fields, part 3 of the major builds skills in supporting STEM fields through three\nclasses: one in scientific computing, one in statistics, and one additional supporting science elective.\n \nPage 359 of 1019",
    "Track 1": "students may elect to participate in the Honors Program designed for highly motivated students who want to pursue\nresearch as undergraduates. Opportunities for research may be available to other students outside of the Honors\nProgram.\n \nAt least 36 credit hours toward the major are required as follows:\n \n1. EES Foundations (3+1 credit hours each): Two introductory courses, one with lab, from\n1510/1510L, 1030/1030L, and/or 1081/1081L\n7\n2. EES Core (4 credit hours): 2510, \nRequired as prerequisite for nearly all upper level EES courses\n4\n3. STEM Foundation (3 credit hours each): \nOne course in scientific computing: CS 1101 or DS 1101\nOne course in statistics: MATH 1011, DS 2100, BSCI 3270, ECON 1500 or 1510, MATH 218,\n2820, or 2821, SOC 2100\nOne additional supporting science: any additional course from ASTR, BSCI, CHEM, MATH,\nPHYS, CS, DS excluding courses numbered 1111 and excluding BSCI 1400. Other courses from\nthe School of Engineering may be considered with permission of the DUS\n9\n4. EES Focus (1-4 credit hours each):\nAt least five classes and at least 15 hours, chosen from any EES course numbered 2050 or\nabove 3000. Must include at least two courses at the 4000 level. At least eight hours in this\ncategory must be experiential, from the following: lab courses (EES 3220, 3260, 3280, 3310,\n3330, 3340), field-based courses (EES 3865 [3-4 credit hours or 1 credit hour attached to\nanother regular EES course with permission]), EES 3875, or an include up to three credit hours\nof research or internships (EES 3841, 3842, 3881, 4998, 4999)\n15-17\n5.

Senior Seminar: 4961\n1\n \n \nTotal hours:\n36-41\nTrack 2\nThis track is designed to prepare students for careers as earth and environmental scientists, including entering the\nscience workforce after graduation and/or pursuing postgraduate academic work.\n \nGiven the broad and interdisciplinary nature of EES, it is important that students design an academic plan in\nconsultation with their adviser and referencing the EES Disciplinary Pathway documents, to ensure appropriate\npreparation for their area of interest. Preparing to be competitive for graduate programs may include additional\ncoursework beyond the major requirements, particularly advanced math, computing, chemistry, biosciences, or\nphysics, depending on disciplinary interest. Students on this pathway are encouraged to pursue research\nparticularly if aimed at post-graduate academic work.\n \nNote that prerequisite STEM courses (CHEM 1601, PHYS 1501/1601, MATH 1100/1201/1301) may be taken on an\nungraded basis for students above the freshman level, but working knowledge of the course content will be required\nPage 360 of 1019",
    "Track 2": "is organized into six parts, beginning with one of three introductory courses that serve as an entry point. The\nsecond part involves three core courses that provide all Track 2 majors with a common background in methods and\nways of thinking in Earth and environmental sciences. At least one EES core course must be completed before\nstudents may enroll in more advanced focus courses of part four. Specific core courses may be prerequisite for\nrelated upper-level electives, and so students are encouraged to take these early in their academic career. As Earth\nand Environmental sciences employ techniques and foundational knowledge from all other STEM fields, courses in\npart 2 and part 4 of the major have outside STEM courses as prerequisites and part 3 of the major rquires students to\nbuild additional skills in supporting STEM fields through two more STEM electives: one of which must be quantitative\nor computational.\n \nThe fourth part of the major defines a focus for the student through both experiential and seminar-style EES courses.\nThe fifth component addresses science communication skills with one course.  The sixth component of the major is a\n1 credit hour seminar that serves as a capstone for senior students. Track 2 students are strongly encouraged to\npursue research. Highly motivated and successful students may elect to participate in the EES Honors Program.\n \nAt least 37 credit hours toward the major are required as follows:\n \n1. EES Foundations (3+1 credit hours each): One introductory course with lab, from\n1510/1510L, 1030/1030L, and/or 1081/1081L\n4\n2. EES Core (4 credit hours): 2510, 2550, and one course in physical dynamics from the\nfollowing list: EES 2580, 4420, 4550, 4650.

Students\nshould consult with their major adviser and follow guidance documents posted on the departmental website to\nchoose a focus area and associated course options. All parts of the Earth and its environments are interconnected,\nand the integrated Earth and Environmental Science major allows students to create a comprehensive\nunderstanding of the cycling of energy and materials through Earth\u2019s four spheres (lithosphere, hydrosphere,\natmosphere, and biosphere) while also developing some more specific expertise through a focus.  \nHonors in Earth and Environmental Sciences\nThe EES Honors Program provides research experience and mentoring in preparation for a career or graduate\nstudies in Earth and environmental sciences. Interested students should apply to the undergraduate adviser for\nentry into the Honors Program fall semester, junior year. A grade point average of 3.3 or higher both cumulatively\nand in courses that count toward the EES major is required for admission to the Honors Program.\nWorking closely with a faculty adviser, students in the Honors Program complete a research project of interest to\nboth the student and faculty member during the junior and senior years. In order to graduate with honors in EES, a\nstudent must: (1) maintain a 3.3 grade point average both in the EES major and cumulatively; (2) complete the\nrequired courses for the EES major; (3) complete Senior Honors Seminar (4996, 4997) and Senior Honors Research\n(4998, 4999); (4) satisfactorily present the results of his/her research in written form as a senior thesis to two\nmembers of the faculty and orally to students and faculty of the department.\n \nMinor in Earth and Environmental Sciences\nThe minor in EES provides students with a broad background in Earth processes, systems, and history, and an\nintroduction to environmental issues. This background is highly relevant to many different fields of endeavor. The\nminor does not fully prepare students for graduate studies or employment as Earth or environmental scientists,\nthough it could do so paired with another relevant STEM major. Students should consult with the director of\nundergraduate studies about how the minor in EES fits with their career or graduate school interests.\n \nThe minor consists of at least five courses (at least 17 credit hours; EES 1510/1510L, 1030/1030L, and EES\n1081/1081L each count as one course). Students are encouraged to choose courses based on their interests and\ncareer plans and to discuss course selection with the director of undergraduate studies. No more than two 1000-\nlevel courses count toward the minor. Two courses with labs are required; one must be numbered above 2000. No\ncredit toward the minor is given for EES 3841\u20133842 or 3851\u20133852.\n \nLicensure for Teaching\nEES majors may choose a second major in science education which includes teaching licensure, a prudent choice if\ninterested in teaching. Peabody offers a fifth-year master\u2019s program for science majors interested in teaching. Upon\ngraduating with a B.A. in EES, EES majors in the fifth-year program would spend the next summer and academic\nyear earning their M.Ed. and teaching licensure.\n \nStudents seeking teacher certification in science disciplines at the secondary level should refer to the chapter on\nCertification for Teaching in the Peabody College section of the Undergraduate Catalog.

Many students will use the program in history of art\nand architecture as a foundation for careers in which analytical reading and writing skills gained in the major are\nespecially valued: as the basis for advanced training in professional schools (such as architecture, law, medicine,\njournalism, and business), for postgraduate work in history of art or architecture, and for employment in galleries,\nmuseums, or design-related fields. The department helps students become readers of visual images and material\nculture throughout their lives, and encourages visual approaches to learning. In addition, the department provides\npractical experience in research, writing, and exhibition organization that are key to pursuing museum and gallery\ncareers, as well as courses in museum studies.\n \nMajors in history of art and architecture participate in the activities of the Vanderbilt History of Art Society, the\nstudent architecture group, and work closely with departmental advisers. The History of Art Society and the\ndepartment sponsor events such as panels, lectures, debates, and other programs where majors meet and engage\nin discussions with historians of art and museum curators.\n \nThe department curriculum complements those of related departments and programs, including African American\nand Diaspora Studies, American Studies, Anthropology, Asian Studies, Cinema and Media Arts, Classical and\nMediterranean Studies, European Studies, Gender and Sexuality Studies, Latin American, Caribbean, and Latinx\nStudies, and Religious Studies.\n \nPage 401 of 1019",

The program is\nopen to all history of art and architecture majors with junior standing who have earned a 3.30 grade point average\nin all university courses and a 3.30 grade point average in history of art courses. They must also be approved for\nacceptance into the honors program by the department faculty. Completion of the program requires 9 credit hours\nof study: HART 3850, Independent Research (the second semester of the junior year, unless studying abroad, in\nwhich case one is expected to enroll in this class the first semester of the junior year); HART 4998, Honors Research\n(first semester of the senior year); and HART 4999, Honors Thesis (second semester of the senior year); submission\nof an honors thesis; and successful completion of an oral defense of the thesis. These independent research credit\nhours are in addition to the 30 credit hours required for the major in history of art or architecture and the built\nenvironment. Students meeting these requirements receive honors or highest honors in history of art or architecture\nand the built environment, depending on the quality of the thesis, grades in history of art and architecture courses,\nand defense results.

The minor is administered by the School of Engineering.\n \nNanoscience and nanotechnology are based on the ability to synthesize, organize, characterize, and manipulate\nmatter systematically at dimensions of ~1 to 100 nm, creating uniquely functional materials that differ in properties\nfrom those prepared by traditional approaches. At these length scales, materials can take on new properties that\ncan be exploited in a wide range of applications such as for solar energy conversion, ultra-sensitive sensing, and\nnew types of vaccines. These activities require the integration of expertise from various areas of science and\nengineering, often relying on methods of synthesis, fabrication, and characterization that are beyond those\nPage 435 of 1019",

Logic: 1003 or 3003 (at least 3 credit hours); Ethics: 1005, 3605, 3606, or\n3606W (at least 3 credit hours); History of Philosophy: 2100, 2101, 2102, 2103, or 2104 (at least 6 credit hours). Any\nalterations must be approved by the director of undergraduate studies. We encourage all majors to work closely\nwith their advisers to select courses that form a coherent whole. The student must take at least 30 credit hours in\nthe major field of which at least 21 credit hours must be in courses beyond the 1000 level.\n \nHonors Program\nThe Honors Program offers opportunities for advanced study in philosophy, including independent research projects\nand/or enrollment in certain graduate seminars (with permission of the instructor). To be admitted to the program,\nthe student must: (a) be a major in philosophy; (b) have a grade point average of 3.3 in all courses; (c) have a 3.5\ngrade point average in philosophy courses; and (d) develop a written proposal for advanced study in consultation\nwith a philosophy faculty sponsor. Students who satisfy these requirements should meet with the director of\nundergraduate studies to review their programs, whereupon the director may nominate the students for honors\nwork. Honors work typically begins in the junior year or in the first semester of the senior year; students in the\nprogram must complete at least 3 credit hours of Philosophy 3999. Students who successfully complete the program\nwhile maintaining the grade point averages of 3.3 generally, and 3.5 in the major, will receive honors in philosophy;\nstudents who do especially distinguished work will receive highest honors.\n \nMinor in Philosophy\nThe minor in philosophy consists of 18 credit hours, including at least 12 credit hours in courses beyond the 1000\nlevel.

An honors program is available for qualified\ndepartmental majors.\n \nA distinguishing feature of the Vanderbilt undergraduate curriculum is the close coupling between teaching and\nresearch. At Vanderbilt, active research groups are studying the physics of elementary particles; nuclear structure\nand heavy-ion reactions; nonlinear interactions of lasers with materials at ultrafast time scales; the behavior of\nelectrons, atoms, molecules, and photons near surfaces; the electric and magnetic properties of living systems; the\nstructure and dynamics of biopolymers; young stars; and cosmology. All professors are engaged in research, and\nundergraduate students can participate in this research informally or through independent study or summer work.\nPage 441 of 1019\nThe Society of Physics Students arranges informal discussions.\nProgram of Concentration in Physics\nThe departmental major provides a thorough grounding in the core areas of physics. It is suitable either as\npreparation for careers in science and engineering or as a springboard for applying technical knowledge in such\nfields as business, medicine, law, public policy, and education. The major in the Department of Physics and\nAstronomy consists of 31\u201332 credit hours of course work, distributed as below. Students considering majoring in\nphysics are strongly encouraged to consult with the director of undergraduate studies before registering for classes.\n1. Core courses covering the major subdisciplines of physics \u2014 Students must complete four of the following (12\ncredit hours): Modern Physics and the Quantum World (2255); Classical Mechanics (2275); Electricity,\nMagnetism, and Electrodynamics I (2290); Statistical Physics (3200); Quantum Mechanics I (3651).\n2. Laboratory work \u2014 Students may not use AP credit to satisfy any portion of the laboratory sequence\nrequirement (3\u20134 credit hours):\na. Laboratory Principles I (1912L), Laboratory Principles II (2255L), and Introduction to Experimental\nResearch (2953L); or\nb. 1501L or 1601L, 1502L or 1602L, 2255L, and 2953L if the student has entered the major by taking the\nintroductory physics course sequence 1501 or 1601, 1501L or 1601L, 1502 or 1602, and 1502L or\n1602L. Students considering majoring in physics who begin in 1501 or 1601 and 1501L or 1601L in the\nfall semester are encouraged to take the combination 1502 + 1912L or 1602 + 1912L in the spring\nsemester.\n3. Electives (9 credit hours) \u2014 Pedagogical course work in physics and/or astronomy; research hours (3850,\n3851, 4998) do not count toward this requirement. The course electives may be taken from any 2000-level or\nhigher PHYS or ASTR courses not used to satisfy any other requirement of the major. Other courses may\ncount as electives, such as courses offered by the engineering school (or other departments and schools) that\nare particularly relevant, such as a course in environmental studies, health physics, optics, or materials\nscience. Such exceptions must be approved by the director of undergraduate studies.\n4. Capstone (7 credit hours) \u2014 Computational Physics (3790), 3 credit hours of research (3850, 3851, or 4998)\ntaken across one or more semesters, and the Seminar in Presenting Physics Research (3600). Physics-related\nresearch done in other departments and programs, supervised by Vanderbilt faculty and pre-approved by the\ndirector of undergraduate studies, is also permitted in satisfaction of the research requirement.\nImmersion Experience: A student majoring in physics may choose to complete their Immersion Experience through\nan enhanced research program within the disciplines of either physics or astronomy. To complete the Immersion\nExperience in physics or in astronomy, physics majors must complete at least 5 credit hours of research and earn 1\ncredit hour from PHYS 3600 (Seminar in Presenting Physics Research) and 3 credit hours from PHYS 3790\n(Computational Physics). At least 2 of these credit hours in research must be earned in either 3851 (Undergraduate\nImmersion Research) or 4998 (Honors Research). The other three (3) credit hours may be from any combination of\n3850, 3851, and 4998. Credit hours in research may be from PHYS, from ASTR, or from a combination of PHYS and\nASTR courses.\n \nComputer Science course work: All 2000-level and higher PHYS courses assume students have working skills in\nprogramming. These skills may be learned outside of a regular course, but should be equivalent to that taught in CS\n1104 Programming and Problem Solving. Students who do not already have these skills are strongly advised to take\nthis class in the first semester, prior to beginning the three-semester laboratory sequence in the second semester.\nIn addition, the following Computer Science and/or Scientific Computing courses are strongly recommended for all\nphysics majors: Program Design and Data Structures (CS 2201) or Program Design and Data Structures for Scientific\nComputing (CS 2204); Algorithms (CS 3250) or Scientific Computing Toolbox (SC 3250); and High Performance\nComputing (SC 3260). Physics majors pursuing a second major or minor in computer science should take CS 2201;\nphysics majors pursuing a minor in scientific computing should take CS 2204.\n \nMathematics course work: All physics majors are expected to have high-level skills in mathematics in order to be\nsuccessful in PHYS classes and to prepare for graduate work. MATH courses are not formally required for the major\nin physics; however, most physics courses identify MATH prerequisite or co-requisite courses in order to indicate the\nmathematical skill-level assumed for that class. Multivariable calculus is a co-requisite for 2255 and a prerequisite for\nall other 2000-level or higher PHYS courses. Physics majors are expected to develop a working knowledge of single-\nvariable calculus, multivariable calculus, and ordinary differential equations. The following courses are those\nstrongly recommended for physics majors:\nPage 442 of 1019",

To complete the Immersion\nExperience in physics or in astronomy, physics majors must complete at least 5 credit hours of research and earn 1\ncredit hour from PHYS 3600 (Seminar in Presenting Physics Research) and 3 credit hours from PHYS 3790\n(Computational Physics). At least 2 of these credit hours in research must be earned in either 3851 (Undergraduate\nImmersion Research) or 4998 (Honors Research). The other three (3) credit hours may be from any combination of\n3850, 3851, and 4998. Credit hours in research may be from PHYS, from ASTR, or from a combination of PHYS and\nASTR courses.\n \nComputer Science course work: All 2000-level and higher PHYS courses assume students have working skills in\nprogramming. These skills may be learned outside of a regular course, but should be equivalent to that taught in CS\n1104 Programming and Problem Solving. Students who do not already have these skills are strongly advised to take\nthis class in the first semester, prior to beginning the three-semester laboratory sequence in the second semester.\nIn addition, the following Computer Science and/or Scientific Computing courses are strongly recommended for all\nphysics majors: Program Design and Data Structures (CS 2201) or Program Design and Data Structures for Scientific\nComputing (CS 2204); Algorithms (CS 3250) or Scientific Computing Toolbox (SC 3250); and High Performance\nComputing (SC 3260). Physics majors pursuing a second major or minor in computer science should take CS 2201;\nphysics majors pursuing a minor in scientific computing should take CS 2204.\n \nMathematics course work: All physics majors are expected to have high-level skills in mathematics in order to be\nsuccessful in PHYS classes and to prepare for graduate work. MATH courses are not formally required for the major\nin physics; however, most physics courses identify MATH prerequisite or co-requisite courses in order to indicate the\nmathematical skill-level assumed for that class. Multivariable calculus is a co-requisite for 2255 and a prerequisite for\nall other 2000-level or higher PHYS courses. Physics majors are expected to develop a working knowledge of single-\nvariable calculus, multivariable calculus, and ordinary differential equations. The following courses are those\nstrongly recommended for physics majors:\nPage 442 of 1019\n1. Accelerated Calculus I (1300) and Accelerated Calculus II (1301);\n2. Multivariable Calculus (2300) or Multivariable Calculus and Linear Algebra (2500 and 2501); and\n3. Methods of Ordinary Differential Equations (2420) or Ordinary Differential Equations (2610).\nIn addition, for physics majors considering post-graduate work in physics or in a related field, the following PHYS and\nMATH courses are strongly recommended as electives:\n1. Electricity, Magnetism, and Electrodynamics II (PHYS 2291), Quantum Mechanics II (PHYS 3652),\nMathematical Methods of Physics (PHYS 4005); and\n2. Methods of Linear Algebra (MATH 2410) or Linear Algebra (MATH 2600); Introduction to Probability and\nMathematical Statistics (MATH 2820); Statistics Laboratory (MATH 2820L); Complex Variables (MATH 3110);\nIntroduction to Partial Differential Equations (MATH 3120); Fourier Analysis (MATH 3130); and Advanced\nEngineering Mathematics (MATH 3600).\nLicensure for Teaching\nCandidates for teacher licensure in physics at the secondary level may qualify by taking the basic physics major\ntogether with the requisite education courses described in the chapter on Licensure for Teaching in the Peabody\nCollege section of this catalog.\nHonors Program\nThe Honors Program in the Department of Physics and Astronomy is designed to allow a student to engage in \nadvanced research under the guidance of a faculty member, usually in an area related to an ongoing research\nprogram  in the department. A student majoring in physics interested in Honors (Honors in Physics or Honors in\nAstronomy) will work with a faculty mentor to develop an appropriate research project that will be conducted under\nthe guidance of that faculty member. The Honors project must have a substantial grounding in physics or\nastronomy, but may be conducted under the direct supervision of any faculty member in any department at\nVanderbilt. To be admitted to the Honors Program, a student must submit a two-page research proposal describing\nthe plans for their Honors project, which must be approved by the director of the departmental Honors Program. In\naddition, a student must have completed 2953L, either 2255 or 3651, and meet the minimum GPA requirements for\nhonors programs of the College of Arts and Science.\n \nTo graduate with honors, a student must\nHave at least a 300 cumulative GPA and a 3.300 GPA in courses that count toward the major.\nEarn a minimum of 6 credit hours in research classes (3850, 3851, 4998), leading to an honors thesis, with at\nleast 2 of these credit hours earned in A student who earns credit for 3852 may satisfy this portion of the\nrequirement with 3 credit hours of research earned at Vanderbilt, including at least 2 of these credit hours in\n4998.\nWrite a senior thesis of high merit, as evaluated by the student\u2019s Honors Examination Committee; the thesis\nmay be submitted either in the fall or spring semester of the senior year.\nDemonstrate high attainment on an oral honors examination in which they present and defend their work to\nthe student\u2019s Honors Examination Committee; the oral examination may take place either in the fall or spring\nsemester of the senior year.\nDepartmental Minors\nThe physics and astronomy minors are suitable for students who wish to supplement a related discipline or simply\nhave a general interest in the field. Research is not a requirement for either minor.\nMinor in Physics\nThe minor requires a minimum of 19 credit hours of course work, distributed as follows:\n \nPage 443 of 1019",

Students may not double count any single course for both a required part of the core\nand for an elective.\n \nThe proposed core is interdisciplinary and includes rigorous course work drawn from political science, economics,\nsociology, anthropology, and history. The core provides all PPS students training in the politics, economics, methods,\nsocial contexts, history, and ethics of public policy.\n \nIn addition to developing skills in the core curriculum, PPS students seek more intensive training within areas of\nconcentration. The boundaries of these areas are not mutually exclusive, and together they span a wide range of\npolicy concerns and disciplinary perspectives. Among the five elective courses, students must take three courses in\na single area of concentration. It is also recommended that students choose electives from at least two disciplines.\n \nStudents pursuing the \u201ceconomic policy\u201d concentration must take at least two upper-level electives in economics\nfrom the list (numbered above 3000).\nPrerequisites\nPPS majors must have earned credit for MATH 1201 or 1301, or higher; basic statistics (ECON 1500 or 1510 or both\nMATH 2820L and either 2810 or 2820); and introductory courses in political science and economics (PSCI 1100,\nECON 1010, and ECON 1020).\nCore Curriculum (5 courses, 15 credit hours)\nPSCI 2256 or PPS 2100\n3 credit hours\nECON 3010, 3012, 3020, or 3022\n3 credit hours\nECON 3032, 3035, 3050; SOC 3002; or HOD 2500\n3 credit hours\nPPS 2200 and 2250\n6 credit hours\n \nIf a student cannot take both 2200 and 2250, they may, with prior approval from the director or associate director of\nPublic Policy Studies, substitute one course from ANTH 3122, 3133, 4152; HIST 2722; PSCI 3253; SOC 3315, 3604,\n3605, 3613, 3614.\nElectives and Areas of Concentration (5 courses, 15 credit hours)\nThe track is intended to allow students to go more deeply into one area of public policy (for example: health policy,\nSTEM policy, education policy, criminal justice policy).

    "Program of Concentration in Religious Studies": "31 credit hours. The program of concentration in religious studies seeks to introduce students to the rich diversity of\nreligious traditions in the world (Breadth component) and to build depth of study in areas of specific interest to the\nstudent (Depth component). In addition, the curriculum includes instruction in the range of theories and methods\nused to approach religious traditions academically (Tools of the Discipline component). The student will then be able\nto pursue individual interests (electives).\n \nA maximum of two courses (6 credit hours) outside of the department may count toward the major. Of these, one\ncourse (3 credit hours) outside of the department may count toward the Depth Component. A foreign language\ncourse approved as an elective is not subject to the two-course (6 credit hours) limit. No course may be used to\nsatisfy more than one of the four components of the major.\n \n1.

    "Student Records (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act)": "Page 478 of 1019\nVanderbilt University is subject to the provisions of federal law known as the Family Educational Rights and\nPrivacy Act (also referred to as FERPA). This act affords matriculated students certain rights with respect to their\neducational records. These rights include:\n1. The right to inspect and review their education records within 45 days of the day the University receives a\nrequest for access. Students should submit to the Office of the University Registrar written requests that\nidentify the record(s) they wish to inspect. The Office of the University Registrar will make arrangements\nfor access and notify the student of the time and place where the records may be inspected. If the Office\nof the University Registrar does not maintain the records, the student will be directed to the University\nofficial to whom the request should be addressed.\n2. The right to request the amendment of any part of their education records that a student believes is\ninaccurate or misleading. Students who wish to request an amendment to their educational record should\nwrite the University official responsible for the record, clearly identify the part of the record they want\nchanged, and specify why it is inaccurate or misleading. If the University decides not to amend the record\nas requested by the student, the student will be notified of the decision and advised of his or her right to a\nhearing.\n3. The right to consent to disclosures of personally identifiable information contained in the student\u2019s\neducation records to third parties, except in situations that FERPA allows disclosure without the student\u2019s\nconsent.

First,\nthe U.S. Comptroller General, the U.S. Attorney General, the U.S. Secretary of Education, or state and local\nPage 479 of 1019\neducation authorities (\u201cFederal and State Authorities\u201d) may allow access to student records and PII without\nconsent to any third party designated by a Federal or State Authority to evaluate a federal- or state-supported\neducation program. The evaluation may relate to any program that is \u201cprincipally engaged in the provision of\neducation,\u201d such as early childhood education and job training, as well as any program that is administered by an\neducation agency or institution.\nSecond, Federal and State Authorities may allow access to education records and PII without consent, to\nresearchers performing certain types of studies, in certain cases even when the University objects to or does not\nrequest such research. Federal and State Authorities must obtain certain use-restriction and data security\npromises from the third parties that they authorize to receive PII, but the Authorities need not maintain direct\ncontrol over the third parties.\nIn addition, in connection with Statewide Longitudinal Data Systems, State Authorities may collect, compile,\npermanently retain, and share without student consent, PII from education records, and may track student\nparticipation in education and other programs by linking such PII to other personal information that they obtain\nfrom other Federal or State data sources, including workforce development, unemployment insurance, child\nwelfare, juvenile justice, military service, and migrant student records systems.\nIf a student believes the university has failed to comply with FERPA, he or she may file a complaint using the\nStudent Complaint and Grievance Procedures as outlined in the Student Handbook. If dissatisfied with the\noutcome of this procedure, students may file a written complaint with the Family Policy Compliance Office, U.S.\nDepartment of Education, 400 Maryland Avenue SW, Washington, DC 20202-5920.\nQuestions about the application of the provisions of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act should be\ndirected to the Office of the University Registrar or to the Office of General Counsel.\nThe Vanderbilt Honor Code and the Honor System\nVanderbilt University takes pride in its honor code and its student-run honor system.\nThe statement of the honor code is shared by all ten schools of the university:\nVanderbilt University students pursue all academic endeavors with integrity. They conduct themselves\nhonorably, professionally, and respectfully in all realms of their studies in order to promote and secure an\natmosphere of dignity and trust. The keystone of our honor system is self-regulation, which requires cooperation\nand support from each member of the University community.\nThe Honor System is a time-honored tradition that began with the first classes at Vanderbilt in 1875. Students\nestablished the system and continue to manage it today. It rests on the presumption that all work submitted as\npart of course requirements is produced by the student, without help from any other source unless\nacknowledgement is given in a manner prescribed by the instructor. Cheating, plagiarizing, or otherwise\nfalsifying results of study are specifically prohibited. The system applies not only to examinations but also to\nwritten work and computer programs submitted to instructors. Detailed descriptions of Honor System violations\nand Undergraduate Honor Council procedures are published in the Student Handbook, available on the web at\nvanderbilt.edu/student_handbook.\nResponsibility for the preservation of the system falls on the individual student who, by registration,\nacknowledges the authority of the Undergraduate Honor Council. Students are expected to demand of\nthemselves and their fellow students complete respect for the Honor Code. Ignorance of the regulations is not a\ndefense for abuse of regulations. All incoming students attend a mandatory signing ceremony and educational\nprogram on the Honor System at the beginning of the fall semester.

Each student shall complete at least one immersive experience, followed by a\nculminating project. At its core, Immersion Vanderbilt gives every Vanderbilt student the opportunity to pursue\nintellectual curiosities through immersive experiences and culminating projects that are as creative and unique as\nthe students. Throughout the Immersion Vanderbilt program, students are supported by faculty and the Immersion\nVanderbilt office.\n \nImmersion Vanderbilt is a requirement for all undergraduates. Some majors, minors, programs of study, and classes\nare approved to satisfy the immersive experience, culminating project, or both. To complete the Immersion\nVanderbilt requirement, students engage in one or more experiential learning activities, for which the student has a\nfaculty or staff mentor. The student will complete their immersive experience in one of the six immersion pathways\nof their choosing: 1) Research; 2) Study Abroad; 3) Innovation, Arts, & Design; 4) Civic & Community Engagement;\n5) Leadership & Professional Development; or 6) Internships. When a student engages in research for Immersion, a\nVanderbilt faculty member must be the mentor. Throughout the program, students are prompted to reflect upon\ntheir immersive experiences, which can inform the development of the culminating project. This reflective process\nensures that students gain a deeper understanding of their immersive experience(s) and its significance to their\ngoals.\n \nUpon completing their immersive experience(s), students plan and complete their culminating project. Although\nstudents are encouraged to base their culminating project on their immersive experience(s), this is not required; the\nculminating project can relate to an immersive experience already completed or a new topic.

Leadership and Personal Development. Leadership is one of the most compelling topics of our\ntime, and might be one of the most important attributes for effectiveness in all levels of human endeavor. The\nsuccess of one of the most admired and respected institutions in our country, the military, is founded upon the\nunderstanding and effective application of leadership, and the development of leaders. This course introduces\nstudents to the personal challenges and competencies that are critical to effective leadership. The focus is on\ndeveloping basic knowledge and comprehension of leadership attributes and core leader competencies in a\nuniversal setting and exploring potential applications of these principles and practices at Vanderbilt, in the military\nand in the corporate world. [1]\n \nMS-PC 1210L. Leadership and Personal Development Lab. Leader development is a continuous process of\ntraining, assessment and feedback with the goal of instilling and enhancing desirable behavior in individuals and\norganizations. Within the military science curriculum, this process is called the Leadership Development Program\n(LDP), modeled after the principles spelled out in Field Manual 22-100, Army Leadership, and is standardized both\non campus and in Advanced Camp environments. The flexible methodology of LDP accommodates personalized,\nindividual development at all levels of proficiency throughout the officer educational experience, from program\nentry to commissioning. The LDP includes basic leadership training, periodic assessment and counseling at both\nteam and individual levels by experienced observers. Trends and deficiencies are identified and addressed with\nretraining and reassessment in a continuous cycle. Effective leader development is progressive, building on lessons\nlearned and maximizing individual potential. This course introduces students to the leadership development process\nby providing structured leadership opportunities in a variety of training settings.

During the lab we will\nfocus on individual leadership development where the student begins to plan, organize, and lead small teams and\ngroups in situational training exercises. Students begin to apply leadership skills at the smallest unit level. [1]\nNaval Reserve Officers' Training Corps (NROTC)\nNaval Science\nNaval Science Courses\n \n \nThe Naval Reserve Officer Training Corps (NROTC) unit at Vanderbilt conducts the Naval Officer Education program.\nChallenging academic courses and experience-building events prepare a select group of highly accomplished\nstudents for the opportunity to serve their country as a Navy or Marine Corps officer and receive an education. The\nprimary focus of the NROTC program is to develop the most capable leaders possible by building upon the academic\nstrength of Vanderbilt and providing essential military and leadership education.\n \nStudents participate in the NROTC unit in the scholarship program, the college program, or the naval science\nprogram. College Program students take the prescribed naval science course each semester, participate weekly in\nnaval science lab, and engage in summer training programs after each academic year. The NROTC College Program\nis identical to the scholarship program except for tuition financial benefit and that students only participate in\nsummer training upon completion of their junior academic year. Also, any Vanderbilt student may take any or all of\nthe naval science courses without participating in naval science lab or summer training.\n \nScholarship students receive tuition, fees, uniforms, $375 per semester for textbooks, and a monthly stipend\nbeginning at $250 for freshmen and increasing to $400 for seniors. Vanderbilt may provide scholarship students\nwith up to a $6,000-per-year stipend toward room and board. College Program students are provided uniforms,\ntextbooks for naval science courses, and a monthly stipend of $350 upon commencement of their junior year with\napproval by higher authority based on academic performance and military aptitude.\nPage 30 of 1019\nScholarships. Students can earn scholarships in several ways. Four-year scholarships are determined by national\ncompetition among high school  seniors and graduates. Based on the national ranking, students may be awarded a\nscholarship that covers full tuition. To be eligible, applicants must  have less than 30 semester hours of college\ncredit. College Program students can also be nominated for three- and two-year scholarships by the  NROTC unit.\nThese nominations are based on the students\u2019 academic and military performance at the college level. Sophomores\nnot enrolled in the  College Program are eligible to apply for the two-year NROTC scholarship program. This is a\nnational competition and application is made through the  NROTC unit.\nService obligation. For most students at the beginning of their sophomore year, should they choose to continue with\nthe NROTC program, Navy option scholarship students incur a minimum service obligation of five years active duty,\nand Marine option scholarship students incur a minimum service  obligation of four years of active duty, to be\nserved upon graduation or withdrawal from the program. College Program students incur a three-year  active duty\ncommitment upon graduation or withdrawal from the program. Additional requirements may be required for specific\njob assignments. \n \nSummer training. Summer training for three to four weeks is conducted aboard naval vessels and naval shore\nstations after each of the first three  academic years. Scholarship students are normally required to participate each\nyear. All scholarship and College Program midshipmen are required to  participate in summer training prior to their\nfinal academic year.\nCourse credit. During the four-year program, NROTC Navy-option students are required to complete eight courses\n(24 hours) of naval science, and Marine-option students are required to complete six courses (18 hours) of naval\nscience. Academic credit awarded varies by course and is outlined in the course descriptions below.\n \nRequired Courses for Navy/Marine Scholarship. The following courses are required for students on scholarship:\nCalculus (Navy option only) (6 credits minimum): Mathematics 1200\u20131201, or 1300\u20131301 completed by the\nend of the sophomore year.\nPhysics (Navy option only) (6 credits): 1501\u20131502 or 1601\u20131602 completed by the end of the junior year.\nEnglish (6 credits): Two semesters of any English course or courses containing a designated writing\ncomponent.\nAmerican History/National Security Policy (3 credits): Contact the Naval ROTC unit for a listing of courses\nfulfilling this requirement.\nWorld Culture/Regional Studies (Navy option only) (3 credits): Contact the Naval ROTC unit for a listing of\ncourses fulfilling this requirement.\nInformation. Inquiries regarding enrollment in the Naval ROTC program should be made to the Naval ROTC unit\nrecruiting officer at (615) 322-2671, or by contacting a local Navy or Marine Corps recruiting station.\n \nAdmission to the program is open to both men and women. Physical qualification to Naval Service standards is\nrequired.\n \nNaval Science\nCOMMANDING OFFICER Aaron Buckles\nEXECUTIVE OFFICER Brian Fremming\nNAVAL INSTRUCTORS Arthur Busick, Renny Ignacio\nMARINE INSTRUCTOR Kenneth St Cyr\n \nNaval Science Courses\nPage 31 of 1019\nFor Navy-option NROTC students, the following naval science courses are required for commissioning: NS 1100, HIST\n1690, NS-PC 2410, ES 3231, ES 3230, ES 3232, ES 4233, and NS-PC 4242 and their appropriate labs.

All available information is considered, including secondary school\nacademic record, evidence of academic maturity and independence, extracurricular activities, contributions to and\nimpact on the school and community, scores on standardized tests if submitted (see #3 in Application Procedure\nbelow), and letters of recommendation.\n \nThe admissions process supports the university's mission of scholarship and discovery and is designed to select a\nstudent body with exceptional academic talent, high standards of personal character, serious educational aims, and\nwide-ranging backgrounds, experiences, and perspectives. Policies that govern the selection process have been set\nPage 32 of 1019\nby the vice provost for university enrollment affairs. Please refer to the nondiscrimination statement which appears\nearlier in this catalog.\n \nAdmission to the four undergraduate schools is managed by the Office of Undergraduate Admissions.\n \nProspective students are encouraged to investigate the university by visiting the campus, exploring the Office of\nUndergraduate Admissions website, connecting via social media, and attending college fairs and other programs\nhosted by Vanderbilt admissions officers across the country, around the world, and online. Admissions staff are\navailable to answer questions, assist with understanding campus visit opportunities, provide additional information\nabout degree programs, and link visitors with appropriate campus offices and members of the university community.\nAcademic Preparation\nEvery candidate for admission must present an official transcript of work completed in high school. While our\nadmissions process is holistic, most successful candidates will present a curriculum that includes the equivalent of\nfive academic subjects each year for four years. Recommended course work includes 4 units of English, 4 units of\nmathematics, 4 units of natural science, 2 units of foreign language, 2 units of social science/humanities, and 4 units\nof additional course work in these areas, or other academic courses such as engineering science, computer science,\nsocial science or natural science research, or advanced work in the humanities. Close attention will be paid to the\nrigor of course work presented. It is highly recommended that candidates applying to the School of Engineering have\ntaken calculus, calculus-based physics, and chemistry.\n \nMost successful candidates will have meaningfully engaged with the academic, intellectual, social, and leadership\nopportunities available in the context of their high schools and communities. In exceptionally rare cases, students\nmay be considered for admission before completing four years of high school. In these cases, the Admissions\nCommittee considers especially evidence of maturity and readiness for an immersive, residential college\nexperience.\nApplication Procedure \u2014 First-year Applicants\n1.

The well-\nestablished advanced-placement policy endeavors to recognize exceptional high school preparation, to avoid\nrequiring first-year students to take courses clearly mastered in high school, and to encourage students to begin\ntheir college learning experience at the level most appropriate to their preparation. Advanced placement may be\ngranted on the basis of good performance on the College Board Advanced Placement Examinations, on International\nBaccalaureate tests, or, in some cases, on placement tests given by Vanderbilt. Credit may also be awarded for the\nBritish G.C.E. \u201cA\u201d level examinations, the Advanced International Certificate of Education (AICE), the Cambridge Pre-\nU diploma, and similar tests, such as the French baccalaur\u00e9at, the German abitur, or the Swiss maturit\u00e9\nexaminations. To qualify for credit for the AICE examinations or individual A-level examinations, students must have\nachieved an A*, A, or B thereon. More information on international exam credit is available at\nregistrar.vanderbilt.edu/international-examinations.\n \nCollege Entrance Exams\nStudents may not take college entrance exams after they begin their enrollment at Vanderbilt University for the\npurpose of course placement or academic credit. This applies to SAT, ACT, Advanced Placement, International\nBaccalaureate, and any similar international exams.\n \nAdvanced Placement Credit Policy\nAdvanced Placement Examination grades accepted for advanced placement with credit by the various departments\nat Vanderbilt are listed below. At the determination of individual departments, Advanced Placement Examination\ngrades with a score of 4 or 5 may be accepted for credit. The amount of credit that may be awarded corresponds to\nthe course work waived. Advanced Placement credit does not affect the Vanderbilt grade point average.\n \nStudents of the College of Arts and Science are limited to a total of 18 credit hours earned by any combination of\nadvanced placement, international baccalaureate credit, advanced international credit, and credit by departmental\nexamination, counting toward the minimum number of hours required toward the degree. For students in the\nCollege of Arts and Science, no form of advanced placement credit can be used to fulfill the Achieving Excellence in\nLiberal Education (AXLE) requirements.\n \nInternational Baccalaureate Credit Policy\nInternational Baccalaureate test scores accepted for advanced credit by the various departments at Vanderbilt are\nlisted below. Students who have taken tests in other areas may submit their scores to the Office of Academic\nServices for evaluation by the appropriate departments. Credits are awarded for exams taken at the higher level\nonly. The amount of credit that may be awarded is subject to the same limitations as credit for Advanced Placement.\n \nAdvanced Placement Examination Grades Accepted by Various Departments at Vanderbilt for Advanced\nPlacement with Credit\nAP Exam\nAP Score Vanderbilt Course or Credit Equivalent\nCredit Hours\nAfrican American Studies\nAfrican American Studies\n4 or 5\nAADS No Equivalent\n3\nArt\nArt History\n4 or 5\nHART 1100: History of Western Art I\n3\n \n \nHART 1105: History of Western Art II\n3\nStudio Art: 2-D Design\n4 or 5\nARTS No Equivalent: Art Studio\n3\nPage 35 of 1019\nStudio Art: 3-D Design\n4 or 5\nARTS No Equivalent: Art Studio\n3\nStudio Art: Drawing\n4 or 5\nARTS No Equivalent: Art Studio\n3\n \n \n \n \nComputer Science\nComputer Science A\n5\nCS 1101: Programming & Problem Solving\n3\nComputer Science\nPrinciples\n5\nCS 1000: The Beauty and Joy of Computing\n3\n \n \n \n \nEconomics\nMacroeconomics\n4 or 5\nECON 1010: Principles of Macroeconomics\n3\nMicroeconomics\n4 or 5\nECON 1020: Principles of Microeconomics\n3\n \n \n \n \nEnglish\nEnglish Language &\nComposition\n4 or 5\nENGL 1300W: Intermediate Composition\n3\nEnglish Literature &\nComposition\n4 or 5\nENGL 1220W: Drama Forms and Techniques\n3\n \n \nENGL 1230W: Literature and Analytical Thinking\n3\n \n \n \n \nGovernment and Politics\nGovernment & Politics:\nComparative\n4 or 5\nPSCI 1101: Introduction to Comparative Politics\n3\nGovernment & Politics:\nUnited States\n4 or 5\nPSCI 1100: Introduction to American Government and\nPolitics\n3\n \n \n \n \nHistory\nEuropean History\n4 or 5\nHIST No Equivalent: European History\n3\nUnited States History\n4 or 5\nHIST No Equivalent: U.S. History\n3\nWorld History\n4 or 5\nHIST No Equivalent: World History\n3\n \n \n \n \nHuman Geography (No credit)\nLanguages\nChinese Language and\nCulture\n4\nCHIN 2201: Intermediate Chinese I\n5\nChinese Language and\nCulture\n5\nCHIN 2201: Intermediate Chinese II\n5\nFrench Language\n4 or 5\nFREN 2203: Contemporary Francophone Cultures\n3\n \n \nFREN 2501W: French Composition and Grammar\n3\nGerman Language\n4 or 5\nGER 2201: Intermediate German I\n3\n \n \nGER 2202: Intermediate German II\n3\nItalian Language and\nCulture\n4 or 5\nITA 2203: Italian Journeys\n3\n \n \nITA 2501W: Grammar and Composition\n3\nJapanese Language and\nCulture\n4\nJAPN 2201: Intermediate Japanese I\n3\nPage 36 of 1019\nJapanese Language and\nCulture\n5\nJAPN 2202: Intermediate Japanese II\n3\nLatin\n4 or 5\nLAT 2202: Intermediate Latin: Poetry\n3\nSpanish Language or\nLiterature (beyond Fall\n2021 admission) \n4\nSPAN 2010: Non-equivalent credit; convertible to SPAN\n2204 with proctored departmental placement score of 410\nor above.\n3\nSpanish Language\n(beyond Fall 2021\nadmission)\n5\nSPAN 2012: Non-equivalent credit; convertible to SPAN\n3302 with proctored departmental placement score of 460\nor above.\n3\nSpanish Literature\n(beyond Fall 2021\nadmission)\n5\nSPAN 2011: Non-equivalent credit; convertible to SPAN\n3301W with proctored departmental placement score of 460\nor above.\n3\n \n \n \n \nMathematics\nCalculus AB\n5\nMATH 1300: Accelerated Single-Variable Calculus I\n4\nCalculus BC & AB\nSubscore\n3 & 5\nMATH 1300: Accelerated Single-Variable Calculus I\n4\nCalculus BC & AB\nSubscore\n4 & 5\nMATH 1300: Accelerated Single-Variable Calculus I\n4\nCalculus BC\n5\nMATH 1300: Accelerated Single-Variable Calculus I\n4\n \n \nMATH 1301: Accelerated Single-Variable Calculus II\n4\nPrecalculus\n \n                  No credit\n \nMusic\nMusic Theory\n5\nMUTH 1200: Survey of Music Theory\n3\nNo course credit awarded for music majors.\n \n \n \n \nPsychology\nPsychology\n5\nPSY 1200: General Psychology\n3\n \n \n \n \nSciences\nBiology\n4 or 5\nBSCI 1100: Biology Today\n3\n \n \nBSCI 1100L: Biology Today Laboratory\n1\nChemistry\n5\nCHEM 1601: General Chemistry\n3\n \n \nCHEM 1601L: General Chemistry Laboratory\n1\n \n \nCHEM 1602: General Chemistry\n3\n \n \nCHEM 1602L: General Chemistry Laboratory\n1\nEnvironmental Science  \n4 or 5\nEES No Equivalent\n3\nPhysics 1\n5\nPHYS 1010: Introductory Physics\n3\n \n \nPHYS 1010L: Introductory Physics Lab\n1\nNone of the credits awarded for Physics 1 shall count toward the major or the minor in physics.

Vanderbilt summer session.\n \nThe following conditions must be met: (a) students must be in the upper 25 percent of their high school class and be\nrecommended by their principal or counselor; (b) courses taken in the Vanderbilt summer session must be chosen\nby the student in consultation with his or her high school counselor and the director of the Division of Unclassified\nStudies so as to supplement and not overlap the total high school program. A student may take two courses in any\none summer, or three courses by special authorization of the director of the Division of Unclassified Studies.\n \nCourse work done at Vanderbilt by a pre-college student may count toward the high school diploma and as part of\nthe entrance requirements for regular admission to Vanderbilt. All course work done at Vanderbilt by pre-college\nstudents will be credited toward the degree for those who may subsequently matriculate at Vanderbilt, unless the\ncourse work is required for high school graduation. Admission to the pre-college summer school program does not\nadmit a student as a regular entering freshman, nor does it commit the university to a student\u2019s admission.\n \nCredit for Previous College Work\nEntering first-year students who have taken college work in high school through dual enrollment or concurrent\nenrollment programs, or during summers prior to their offer of admission to Vanderbilt, must indicate such work on\nthe undergraduate admission application. An official transcript showing any prior college work must be provided.\nOnce all required documentation has been received, the coursework will be reviewed to determine whether it is\neligible for credit at Vanderbilt.\n \nStudents should submit all required documentation for review before the first day of classes of their freshman year.\n \nCredit will be awarded only if:\n1. A course is regularly offered by an accredited two-year or four-year college or university. For domestic\nschools, the school must be regionally accredited; for international schools, the school must have country-\nspecific accreditation.\n2. The teacher was a regular faculty member of that college or university.\n3. A majority of the students in the course were degree-seeking college students.\nAdditional requirements and guidelines regarding pre-freshman credit are available\nat registrar.vanderbilt.edu/transfer-credit.php.\n \nThe College of Arts and Science and Peabody College usually do not award credit for work at other colleges in the\nsummer immediately preceding the student\u2019s first semester at Vanderbilt. Summer work elsewhere will be accepted\nfor credit only if an unusual educational opportunity can be demonstrated and if the courses sought are as rigorous\nas courses offered at Vanderbilt. Approval for work to be taken elsewhere must be obtained in advance from the\nappropriate dean.\n \nPage 41 of 1019\nCollege of Arts and Science. In no case may credits completed elsewhere after the student has been offered\nadmission by the College of Arts and Science satisfy AXLE requirements.\nInternational Students\nVanderbilt has a large international community representing more than 95 countries. The university welcomes the\ndiversity international students bring to the campus and encourages academic and social interactions at all levels.\n \nAdmission.

Applicants\nmust provide documentary evidence of their financial resources before visa documents can be issued.\n \nUnited States laws and regulations restrict the opportunity for international students in a non-immigrant visa status\nto be employed. Undergraduate international students are allowed to work on campus for nineteen hours per week\nwhile school is in session. Students may be allowed to work off campus only under special circumstances and after\napproval from ISSS. Many spouses and dependents of international students are not allowed to be employed while in\nthe United States.\n \nLimited need-based financial aid is available to students who are neither citizens nor permanent residents of the\nUnited States, and are considered to be international students in Vanderbilt\u2019s admissions process. Our admissions\nprocess is need-aware for international students; international students who demonstrate that they can afford the\ncost of attending Vanderbilt will be given preferential treatment. To apply for need-based financial aid, international\nstudents are required to submit the College Scholarship Service (CSS) Financial Aid Profile. Based upon an\nevaluation of academic qualities, financial need, and availability of resources, an international student may be\nconsidered for need-based financial assistance. International students who apply for need-based financial aid will be\nadmitted only if they are competitive in our holistic review and if Vanderbilt is able to provide adequate financial\nassistance.\n \nInternational Student Health Insurance. International students are required to have health insurance throughout\ntheir academic program and are automatically enrolled in the Vanderbilt-approved health insurance plan for\ninternational students.

Grants, scholarships,\nand work opportunities are available to eligible students who apply for assistance and have demonstrated financial\nneed. Beginning in the fall of 2009, financial aid packages offered to incoming and current undergraduate students\nno longer included need-based loans. While continuing to meet the full demonstrated need of all eligible students,\nthis expanded aid initiative, Opportunity Vanderbilt, announced in October 2008 provides increased amounts of\nneed- based grants and/or scholarships (gift assistance) to replace need-based loans that would have otherwise\nbeen offered to meet a student\u2019s demonstrated financial need.\n \nDemonstrated financial need is the difference between the cost of attending Vanderbilt and the amount that\nstudents and their families are expected to contribute toward that cost. The amount of aid to fully meet each\nstudent\u2019s demonstrated financial need is determined annually on the basis of current financial information\nrequired/provided on relevant application forms.\n \nAdditional information is available at https://www.vanderbilt.edu/financialaid/undergraduate/index.php. \nUniversity General Medals, Prizes, and Awards\nAlso see the Honors chapters in the College of Arts and Science, Blair School of Music, School of Engineering, and\nPeabody College sections of this catalog for listings of additional awards and prizes.\n \nTHE JESSICA ACESTE AND ELIZABETH BEALE RIPPLE IN THE POND AWARD was established in 2001 by Mr. and Mrs.\nGeorge G.

Failure\nto do so may jeopardize graduation.\nClass Attendance (A&S, Blair, VUSE, PBDY)\nArts & Science: Students are expected to attend all scheduled meetings of classes in which they are enrolled; they\nhave an obligation to contribute to the academic performance of all students by full participation in the work of each\nclass. At the beginning of the semester, instructors explain the policy regarding absences in each of their classes,\nand thereafter they report to the Dean\u2019s Office of Undergraduate Education in the College of Arts and Science the\nname of any student whose achievement in a course is being adversely affected by excessive absences. In such\ncases an associate dean, in consultation with the instructor, takes appropriate action, which may include dropping\nthe student from the class; students dropped after the deadline for withdrawal (see Period for Withdrawal) receive\nthe grade F. Class attendance may be specified as a factor in determining the final grade in a course, and it cannot\nfail to influence the grade even when it is not considered explicitly.\n \nPage 56 of 1019\nThe last day before and the first day after official holidays are considered to be the same as any other day on which\nclasses are scheduled. Assignments are made for classes scheduled on these days, and tests may be given in them.\nStudents should take this fact into account in making travel plans.\n \nThe faculty of the College of Arts and Science recognizes that occasions arise during the academic year that merit\nthe excused absence of a student from a scheduled class or laboratory during which an examination, quiz, or other\ngraded exercise is given. Examples include participation in sponsored university activities (e.g., debate team,\nvarsity sports), observance of officially designated religious holidays, serious personal problems (e.g., serious\nillness, death of a member of the student\u2019s family), and matters relating to the student\u2019s academic training (e.g.,\ngraduate or professional school interviews). While determination of the merit of a case is left primarily to the\ndiscretion of the individual instructor, conflicts arising from personal travel plans or social obligations do not qualify\nas excused absences. The Dean\u2019s Office of Undergraduate Education does not grant excused absences for students.\nFor more information please visit as.vanderbilt.edu/academics/policies/absences.php.\n \nThe primary determination of whether a student\u2019s absence from class occurs for a reason that warrants\nrescheduling a graded exercise for that student is left to the judgment of the individual instructor. A standard of\nreasonableness should apply in making such judgments.\n \nExcept in cases of true emergency, student petitions for making up missed graded exercises must be made prior to\nthe missed class, preferably at the beginning of the semester or at the earliest time thereafter when the need to be\nabsent is known to the student. Faculty members retain discretion in the form and timing of makeup exercises or in\ndevising other strategies for accommodating students.\n \nThe faculty of the College of Arts and Science authorizes the Office of the Dean to resolve through arbitration any\ncases that cannot be directly resolved between students and their instructors.\n \nBlair: Students are expected to attend all sessions of each class in which they are enrolled.

At the beginning of the semester, instructors explain the policy regarding absences in each of their classes,\nand thereafter they report to the office of the dean of the college the name of any student whose achievement in a\ncourse is being adversely affected by excessive absences. In such cases, the dean, in consultation with the\ninstructor, takes appropriate action, which may include dropping the student from the class; students dropped after\nthe deadline for withdrawal receive the grade F. Class attendance may be specified as a factor in determining the\nfinal grade in a course, and it cannot fail to influence the grade even when it is not considered explicitly.\nClassroom Recording Policy (A&S, Blair)\nArts & Science/Blair: The use of technologies for audio and video recording of lectures and other classroom\nactivities is allowed only with the express permission of the instructor. In cases where recordings are allowed, such\ncontent is restricted to personal use only unless permission is expressly granted in writing by the instructor and by\nPage 57 of 1019\nother classroom participants, including other students. Personal use is defined as use by an individual student for\nthe purpose of studying or completing course assignments. When students have permission for personal use of\nrecordings, they must still obtain written permission from the instructor to share recordings with others.\n \nFor students registered with the Office of Student Access Services and who have been approved for audio and/or\nvideo recording of lectures and other classroom activities as a reasonable accommodation, applicable federal law\nrequires instructors to permit those recordings. Such recordings are also limited to personal use, except with\npermission of the instructor and other students in the class.\nAcademic Advising (Blair, VUSE, PBDY)\nBlair: All entering students are assigned academic advisers who assist in the planning of programs and course\nschedules. Students are required to meet with their advisers prior to registration for each semester.\n \nEngineering: A faculty adviser is appointed for each student. This adviser is chosen from the faculty in the\nstudent\u2019s major, when the major is known. For students who have not chosen a major upon entry, an adviser who\nspecializes in helping undeclared students explore different pathways and decide upon a major is assigned. If a\nstudent later chooses a different department for his or her major, a corresponding change of adviser is made.\nEngineering students are required to see their advisers at registration and any other time changes must be made in\ntheir programs of study. Any student who has academic difficulty is expected to see his or her faculty adviser for\ncounsel. Faculty advisers can also provide useful career guidance.\n \nPeabody: Each Peabody undergraduate is assigned an academic adviser who is familiar with his or her major. This\nadviser is generally a faculty member in the major department and is knowledgeable about the courses the student\nwill need to complete his or her major. The adviser helps the student determine the courses that are most suitable\nfor the chosen major and serves as a mentor to the student.\n \nHowever, enrollment in appropriate courses to fulfill degree requirements and knowledge of university policies and\nregulations regarding courses are the responsibility of the individual student.\nCourse Enrollment & Management\nRegistration (A&S, Blair, VUSE)\nNormal Course Load (A&S, Blair, VUSE, PBDY)\nChange of Course (Blair, VUSE)\nPass/Fail (A&S, Blair, VUSE, PBDY)\nWithdrawal (A&S, Blair, VUSE, PBDY)\nTaking Courses for No Credit (A&S, Blair)\nAuditing (A&S, Blair, VUSE, PBDY)\nIndependent Study (A&S, Blair, PBDY)\nMinimum Graded Credit Hours (A&S)\nDuplication of Course Content (A&S, PBDY)\nRepeated Courses (A&S, Blair, VUSE, PBDY)\nUndergraduate Enrollment in Graduate School Courses (A&S, VUSE, PBDY)\nReserving Credit for Graduate School (A&S, PBDY)\nRegistration (A&S, Blair, VUSE)\nPage 58 of 1019\nArts & Science: A period is designated in each semester during which continuing students, after consultation with\ntheir advisers, register for work to be taken during the next term. The student\u2019s adviser must release the advising\nhold in YES before the student can register.\n \nStudents are asked to plan their immediate and long-range educational programs with their advisers before\nregistering and to consult their advisers when they make changes in their registration.\n \nStudents not meeting specified tuition payment deadlines are not permitted to register. See the chapter on Financial\nInformation for details.\nBefore registering, students should check their own records carefully with respect to the following items:\n1. AXLE requirements;\n2. Major requirements;\n3. Requirements of any optional minor(s) sought;\n4. Course prerequisites.\nBlair: Registration is available to entering first-year students in June. Continuing students register on dates\nspecified each semester in the University Calendar and as assigned in \u201cYES\u201d (Your Enrollment\nServices, yes.vanderbilt.edu). Conferences with faculty advisers are required before students may register. Detailed\ninformation on registration is available on the University Registrar\nwebsite, registrar.vanderbilt.edu/registration/registration-info.php. Prior to registration, students should refer to the\nsample curriculum plans in the Blair Student Handbook.\n \nRecords and the degree audit should be checked regarding progress toward completing the following:\n1. Music core\n2. Liberal arts core\n3. Additional major area requirements\nA student whose registration choices are denied or altered (full or cancelled class, lack of prerequisite courses, etc.)\nmay select alternate courses during the Open Enrollment registration period.\n \nEngineering: A period is designated in each semester during which continuing students, after consultation with\ntheir advisers, register for work to be taken during the next term. Students can access their registration\nappointment times and the registration system via YES (Your Enrollment Services) at yes.vanderbilt.edu.\nNormal Course Load (A&S, Blair, VUSE, PBDY)\nArts & Science: Each semester, regular tuition is charged on the basis of a normal course load of 12 to 18\nsemester hours. No more than 18 or fewer than 12 credit hours may be taken in any one semester without\nauthorization of the Administrative Committee or an associate dean in 350 Buttrick Hall. (There is an extra charge\nfor more than 18 credit hours at the current hourly rate.) First-year students may not take more than 18 credit hours\nin a semester.\n \nStudents permitted to take fewer than 12 credit hours are placed on probation, unless their light load is necessary\nbecause of outside employment or illness. During the summer session, there is no minimum course load. Summer\nloads exceeding 14 credit hours must be authorized by an associate dean in 350 Buttrick Hall.\n \nCredit hours are semester hours; e.g., a three-hour course carries credit of 3 semester hours. One semester credit\nhour represents at least three hours of academic work per week, on average, for one semester. Academic work\nincludes, but is not necessarily limited to, lectures, laboratory work, homework, research, class readings,\nindependent study, internships, practica, studio work, recitals, practicing, rehearsing, and recitations. Some\nVanderbilt courses may have requirements that exceed this definition.\nPage 59 of 1019\nA student must be enrolled in a minimum of 12 credit hours to be classified as a full-time student.\n \nBlair: Tuition is charged on the basis of a normal course load of 12 to 18 semester hours. Course loads outside the\nnorm, which must be recommended by the student\u2019s adviser and approved by the associate dean, are charged at\nan hourly tuition rate. Students who enroll in fewer than 12 hours are placed on probation, unless their underload is\nnecessary because of outside employment or illness. The maximum course load for the summer session is 12 hours\n(6 hours for a summer half-session). A student must be enrolled in a minimum of 12 hours to be classified as a full-\ntime student.\n \nEngineering: Each semester, regular tuition is charged on the basis of a normal course load of 12 to 18 semester\nhours. No more than 18 or fewer than 12 hours may be taken in any one semester without authorization from the\nsenior associate dean.\nThere is an extra charge for more than 18 hours at the current hourly rate. Students permitted to take fewer than\n12 hours are placed on probation, unless their light load is necessary because of illness or outside employment and\nis approved by the senior associate dean. A student must be enrolled in a minimum of 12 hours to be classified as a\nfull-time student.\n \nPeabody: A student must be enrolled in a minimum of 12 hours to be classified as a full-time student. Students\nwishing to carry more than 18 hours must obtain the approval of the Associate Dean for Undergraduate Academic\nAffairs. All undergraduate students are assumed to be full-time students for the purpose of administering probation\nand retention policies. A student who for reasons of health, family, or outside employment wishes to enroll in\nPeabody as a part-time student must obtain permission from the Associate Dean for Undergraduate Academic\nAffairs. The academic standing of such students will be considered on an individual basis. Normally, however, a\nstudent earning less than 12 hours will be placed on academic probation.\nChange of Course (Blair, VUSE)\nBlair: Course changes may be made during the Open Enrollment period or the official Change Period (Drop/Add) as\npublished in the University Calendar. All changes need the adviser\u2019s approval. A course dropped during the Change\nPeriod does not show on a transcript.\n \nA course may be dropped or changed from P/F to graded status prior to the deadline for withdrawal published in the\nUniversity Calendar. The approval of the adviser and associate dean is required (see Grading System regarding\nwithdrawal grades). Regularly enrolled students must maintain a minimum course load of 12 hours.\n \nEngineering: During the change period of registration as defined in the Academic Calendar, students may add or\ndrop courses without academic penalty. No record of courses dropped during the change period appears on the\nacademic record. After the change period, new courses may not be added, except under very unusual\ncircumstances and with the approval of the adviser, the course instructor, and the senior associate dean.\nPass/Fail (A&S, Blair, VUSE, PBDY)\nArts & Science: Students may elect to take a limited number of courses on a Pass/Fail (P/F) basis. To enroll for a\ncourse on a Pass/Fail basis, students must have achieved at least sophomore standing, and must not be on\nacademic probation. A minimum 12 graded credit hours is required.\n \nA graduating senior who has permission to take fewer than 12 credit hours on a graded basis may take one course\non a P/F basis in addition to the courses required for graduation. If the student does not graduate at the end of that\nsemester, the P grade is automatically converted to the grade actually earned.\n \nPage 60 of 1019\nNo more than 18 credit hours graded P may be counted toward the degree, and no more than one course per term\nmay be taken P/F.\n \nThe P/F option does not apply to courses in the following categories:\n1. Courses counted toward AXLE requirements;\n2. Courses in the major field(s), other courses that may be counted toward the major(s), or courses required for\nthe major(s);\n3. For students with a defined interdisciplinary major, courses that are required for the major or that are eligible\nto count toward the major;\n4. For students with an individually designed interdisciplinary major, courses listed in the student\u2019s plan of\nstudy;\n5. For students planning an optional minor, courses in the minor field or those eligible to count toward an\ninterdisciplinary minor;\n6. Courses eligible to count toward the major or minor, regardless of whether the student has already satisfied\nmajor or minor requirements;\n7. Courses that have been specifically excluded from the P/F option;\n8. Courses taken previously.\nStudents may elect grading on a Pass/Fail basis or change from Pass/Fail to graded status until the deadline date for\nwithdrawing from a course that is published in the Academic Calendar. Pass/Fail rules, requirements, and deadlines\nare not petitionable.\n \nThose electing the Pass/Fail option must meet all course requirements (e.g. reports, papers, examinations,\nattendance, etc.) and are graded in the normal way. Instructors are not informed of the names of students enrolled\non a Pass/Fail basis. At the end of the semester, a regular grade is submitted for the student enrolled under the P/F\noption. Any grade of D\u2013 or above is converted in the Student Records System to a P, while an F will be recorded if a\nstudent enrolled under this option fails the course. The P grade is not counted in the grade point average nor used\nin the determination of honors. The grade of F earned under the Pass/Fail option is included in the calculation of the\ngrade point average.\n \nThe grade for a class will be converted from P to the recorded letter grade if a student later declares a major or\nminor toward which that class counts. The recorded letter grade will be included in both the overall and the major or\nminor grade point average.\n \nBlair: Students may elect to take a limited number of courses on a Pass/Fail (P/F) basis. To enroll for a course on a\nPass/Fail basis, students must have completed at least two semesters at Vanderbilt, must have achieved at least\nsophomore standing, and must not be on academic probation. The Blair Office of Academic Services can assist with\nP/F registration.\n \nFor B.Mus. and B.Mus.Arts students, the Pass/Fail option is limited to courses taken as free electives. Course work in\nthe area of a minor or second major is governed by the school in which the department or program is housed. No\nmore than one course may be elected on a Pass/Fail basis in any one semester. Only a total of 18 hours towards the\n126-hour degree total may be taken on a Pass/Fail basis. Students electing course work on a Pass/Fail basis must be\nenrolled for 12 graded hours. A graduating senior who has permission to take fewer than 12 hours on a graded basis\nmay take one course on a P/F basis in addition to the courses required for graduation. If the student does not\ngraduate at the end of that semester, the grade P is automatically converted to the grade actually earned.\n \nStudents may register for grading on a Pass/Fail basis and may change from Pass/Fail to graded status until the\ndeadline date for withdrawing from a course that is published in the Academic Calendar.\n \nThose electing the Pass/Fail option must meet all course requirements (e.g., reports, papers, examinations,\nattendance, etc.) and are graded in the normal way. Instructors are not informed of the names of students enrolled\nPage 61 of 1019\non a Pass/Fail basis. At the end of the semester, a regular grade is submitted for the student enrolled under the P/F\noption. Any grade of D- or above is converted in the Student Records System to a P, while an F will be recorded if a\nstudent enrolled under this option fails the course. The P grade is not counted in the grade point average nor used\nin the determination of honors. The grade of F earned under the Pass/Fail option is included in the calculation of the\ngrade point average.\n \nEngineering: Students may elect to take a limited number of courses on a Pass/Fail basis. To enroll for a course on\na Pass/Fail basis, students must have completed at least two semesters at Vanderbilt, must have achieved at least\nsophomore standing, and must not be on academic probation.\n \nIn addition, the following regulations apply to students enrolled in the School of Engineering:\n1. No more than 9 hours graded Pass will be accepted toward the B.S. or B.E. degree, as designated by each\nprogram's curriculum.\n2. No more than two courses may be taken on a Pass/Fail basis in any one semester.\n3. A minimum of 12 hours must be taken on a graded basis in any semester that a Pass/Fail course is taken. A\ngraduating senior who needs fewer than 12 hours to graduate may take courses on a Pass/Fail basis as long\nas he or she takes the number of hours needed to graduate on a graded basis.\n4. Students may elect grading on a Pass/Fail basis and may change from Pass/Fail to graded status until the\ndeadline date for withdrawing from a course that is published in the Academic Calendar.\nPass/Fail Electives Options by Program\n \nOpen Elective\nLiberal Arts Core\nTechnical Elective\nBME\nX\nX\n \nCE\nX\nX\n \nCHE\nX\n \n \nCMPE\nX\n \n \nCS\nX\nX\nX\nECE\nX\n \n \nES\nX\nX\n \nME\nX\nX\nX (non-ME)\n \n \nThose electing the Pass/Fail option must meet all course requirements (e.g., reports, papers, examinations,\nattendance, etc.) and are graded in the normal way. Instructors are not informed of the names of students enrolled\non a Pass/Fail basis. At the end of the semester, a regular grade is submitted for the student enrolled under the P/F\noption. Any grade of D- or above is converted in the Student Records System to a P, while an F will be recorded if a\nstudent enrolled under this option fails the course. The P grade is not counted in the grade point average or used in\nthe determination of honors. The grade of F earned under the Pass/Fail option is included in the calculation of the\ngrade point average.\n \nPeabody: Students may elect to take some courses in which they can receive the grade P (Pass). This grade is\nentered for the student enrolled under the P/F option who is awarded a grade of D- or higher. The grade P is neither\ncounted in the grade point average nor used in the determination of honors. A failing grade will appear on the\nstudent record as F and will be counted in the student\u2019s grade point average.\n \nTo be eligible for the P/F option, the student must have completed two regular semesters at Vanderbilt and must not\nbe on academic probation. No more than one course per semester may be taken on a P/F basis and no more than\nthree total during the undergraduate career. No more than one course from any Liberal Education Core area (e.g.,\ncommunications, humanities) may be taken under this option.\n \nPage 62 of 1019\nNote that neither courses taken for transfer credit (grade of \u201cT\u201d) nor courses that are only offered on a pass/fail\nbasis by the university (e.g., certain field experience courses) are counted against the number of courses that a\nstudent may voluntarily elect to take on a pass/fail basis, either within or across semesters.\n \nThe P/F option does not apply to courses in the following categories:\n1. Liberal Education Core Courses that have been specifically identified by the student\u2019s primary major as\nneeding to be taken on a graded basis. \n2. For students with a single or double major, courses in the department(s) of the major(s) or other courses that\nmay be counted for the major(s);\n3. For students with an interdisciplinary major, courses listed in the student\u2019s plan of study;\n4. For students planning an optional minor, courses in the department of the minor or those counting toward an\ninterdisciplinary minor.\nStudents taking a course on a P/F basis must be enrolled for at least 12 additional hours on a regularly graded basis.\nIf a student drops a course and falls below 12 graded hours, the P/F course is converted automatically to a regularly\ngraded basis.\n \nSeniors who meet the above criteria and have permission to take fewer than 12 hours on a graded basis may take\none course on a P/F basis in one of their last two semesters (e.g., a semester in which an internship or student\nteaching is not being taken). If the student does not graduate at the end of the senior year, the grade of P is\nautomatically converted to the grade actually earned. When a student wishes to complete a major or minor in a field\nin which a grade of P has been received, the registrar converts this grade to the regular grade originally earned.\n \nAll P/F students are expected to meet normal course requirements (e.g., reports, papers, examinations, laboratory\nattendance) and are graded in a normal way. At the end of the semester, students enrolled on a P/F basis are\nawarded a regular grade. Any grade of D- or better is converted in the Student Records System to a P, while an F\ngrade remains as awarded. A student taking a course on a P/F basis must meet the course prerequisites as set forth\nin this catalog.\n \nStudents may submit a Pass/Fail request form on or before the Pass/Fail declaration deadline. Students may change\nfrom a P/F basis to a regularly graded basis until the last day to withdraw from classes in a given term. All Pass/Fail\ndeadlines are published in the Academic Calendar. The Pass/Fail form is available\nonline: peabody.vanderbilt.edu/admin-offices/oas/downloads.php.\nWithdrawal (A&S, Blair, VUSE, PBDY)\nArts & Science: After the Change Period, and extending to the deadline published on the Undergraduate Academic\nCalendar, a student may withdraw from a course with approval from the student\u2019s adviser. Under certain conditions,\nwithdrawal may also require approval from an associate dean in 350 Buttrick Hall. During the same period students\nmay change their status from P/F to regularly graded or elect Pass/Fail status in a course.\n \nThese changes must be made with a Change of Course form, which is available online and which the student must\nsubmit to the Dean\u2019s Office of Undergraduate Education in Arts and Science. After the deadline, withdrawal is\npossible only in the most extraordinary circumstances, such as illness or unusual personal or family problems, and in\nall cases must be approved by the Administrative Committee. After the withdrawal deadline, change from P/F to\nregularly graded status is not permitted.\n \nStudents who withdraw from a course after the change period receive the grade W (withdrawal). This grade is not\nused in the computation of the grade point average or class rank. A student who defaults in a course without\ndropping or withdrawing from it receives the grade F.\n \nBlair: A student may withdraw from a course after the official Change Period and prior to the deadline for\nPage 63 of 1019\nwithdrawal published in the University Calendar, generally Friday of the week after mid-semester. A change of\ncourse request form must be signed by the instructor, adviser, and associate dean and filed with the Office of\nAcademic Services. (Students from other schools of the university must file with their home school.) Withdrawals\nafter the published deadline result in an F. The grade W may be assigned by the associate dean to a student who\nseeks to withdraw from a course or from school after the deadline for reasons such as extended illness or unusual\npersonal or family problems. No W grades are calculated in a student\u2019s grade point average.\n \nEngineering:  After the Change Period and extending to the deadline published on the Undergraduate Academic\nCalendar, a student may withdraw from a course with approval of the student\u2019s adviser. Under certain conditions,\nwithdrawal may also require approval from the senior associate dean. During the same period students may change\ntheir status from P/F to regularly graded or vice versa. The W is recorded for any course from which a student\nwithdraws. A course in which a W is recorded is not used in figuring grade point averages.\n \nPeabody: The symbol W (withdrawal) is assigned in lieu of a grade when a student formally withdraws from a class\nbefore the published mid-semester deadline. After that point, withdrawal will result in an F. A student who\nwithdraws from school for reasons such as illness, unusual personal or family problems, and the like, may petition\nthe Dean\u2019s Office for an authorized administrative withdrawal. If approved, the student will receive the grade W for\ncourses in progress. A student who withdraws from school without an authorized administrative withdrawal receives\nthe grade W or F depending upon the date of withdrawal. The grade W is not included in the calculation of the grade\npoint average.\nTaking Courses for No Credit (A&S, Blair)\nArts & Science: Students may want to take elsewhere in the university courses that are not creditable toward the\nbachelor\u2019s degree. They may do so on a no-credit basis, attending classes, doing all the work of the course, and\nreceiving a grade that is recorded on the transcript with a notation that it does not count toward the degree.\n \nNo-credit courses count in computation of the student\u2019s academic load and in computation of tuition, but not in\ncomputation of the grade point average. They also do not count toward the attainment of class standing.\n \nBlair: Students who wish to take courses on a no-credit basis must file with the Blair Office of Academic Services\nbefore the end of the Change Period. Students must attend class and complete all course work. A grade is recorded\non the transcript with the notation \"Grading Basis: No Credit Toward Current Degree,\" indicating that it does not\ncount toward the degree.\n \nNo-credit courses count in the computation of a student\u2019s academic load and tuition, but not in the computation of\nthe grade point average.\nAuditing (A&S, Blair, VUSE, PBDY)\nArts & Science: Regularly enrolled Arts and Science students who want to audit courses in any of the\nundergraduate schools of the university must obtain the written consent of the instructor to attend the class but do\nnot register for the course for credit. Forms are available from the Dean\u2019s Office of Undergraduate Education in each\nschool. No permanent record is kept of the audit. Regular students may audit one class each semester.\n \nBlair: Regularly enrolled Blair students who want to audit courses in any of the undergraduate schools of the\nuniversity must complete the change of course request form and obtain the written consent of the instructor to\nattend the class but do not register for the course for credit. No permanent record is kept of the audit. Regular\nstudents may audit one class each semester.\n \nEngineering: Regularly enrolled students in the School of Engineering who want to audit courses in any of the\nundergraduate schools of the university must get the written consent of the instructor to attend the class and\nPage 64 of 1019\nregister to audit the course. Forms are available from the School of Engineering Office of Academic Services. No\npermanent record is kept of the audit. Regular students may audit one class each semester.\n \nPeabody: Regularly enrolled Peabody College students who want to audit courses in any of the undergraduate\nschools of the university must obtain the written consent of the instructor to attend the class but do not register for\nthe course for credit. Forms are available online: peabody.vanderbilt.edu/admin-offices/oas/downloads.php. No\npermanent record is kept of the audit. Regular students may audit one class each semester free of charge. In order\nto audit a course, the student must also be enrolled in at least one additional graded credit hour in the same\nsemester.\nIndependent Study (A&S, Blair, PBDY)\nArts & Science: Independent study and directed study courses are intended primarily for students in their junior\nand senior years. Students may not take an independent study or directed study course that duplicates a regular\ncourse being offered in the same semester. Juniors or seniors who wish to take independent study or directed study\ncourses must use the following procedure:\n1. Students may initiate the independent study enrollment process in YES by clicking on the Individual Study link\non the student landing page.\n2. Students must be registered in the independent study before the end of the change period.\nBlair: Students must obtain permission to enroll in Independent Study from the instructor of their choice prior to\nregistration. Independent Study authorization forms are available at blair.vanderbilt.edu/academics. The instructor\u2019s\nsignature on the authorization form indicates a willingness to supervise the Independent Study project. A contract or\nstudy plan, approved by the instructor in consultation with the appropriate department chair and the associate\ndean, must be submitted to the Blair Office of Academic Services by the tenth calendar day after classes begin. If no\nplan is submitted, the student will be dropped from Independent Study. An Independent Study project should result\nin a substantial written report, paper, or lecture/recital. The report, recording, or some physical manifestation of the\nproject should be retained by the instructor. Independent Study projects proposed by students for cross-school\nregistration should be approved through the mechanisms of both schools. Consult associate deans from both\nschools for guidance.\n \nA student may register for a maximum of 3 hours in Independent Study in a semester. A student may count a total\nof 6 hours in Independent Study toward the degree. A faculty member may supervise no more than four students\nper semester in Independent Study projects.\n \nIndependent Study cannot substitute for courses which are part of the curriculum.\n \nPeabody: Independent study courses, ranging from zero to three hours of credit, are listed in the Schedule of\nCourses and are intended for students in their junior and senior years. Students wanting to undertake an\nindependent study must follow these guidelines:\n1. Students must be in academic \u201cgood standing\u201d (may not be on probation or Leave of Absence).\n2. Students must arrange the independent study with a Vanderbilt full time faculty member who has agreed to\nsupervise and grade this course.\n3. Students may enroll for up to 3 hours of independent study in one semester.\n4. Students must make a study plan detailing the nature of the project and the amount of credit. The Individual\nLearning/Directed Study contract must be approved by the instructor and the department chair (or the chair\u2019s\ndesignee) by the last day of the change period.\n5. Registration for the course occurs when the completed Individual Learning/Directed Study contract is\nsubmitted to the Peabody Office of Academic Services. Registration for an independent study will not be\nallowed after the change period has ended.\nStudents may not repeat independent study courses for grade replacement.\nMinimum Graded Credit Hours (A&S)\nArts & Science: A course may not be dropped without authorization of the Administrative Committee or an\nPage 65 of 1019\nassociate dean if the student is left with a course load of fewer than 12 credit hours on a regularly graded basis.\nDuplication of Course Content (A&S, PBDY)\nArts & Science: It is the responsibility of the individual student to avoid duplication in whole or in part of the\ncontent of any course counting toward the degree. Such duplication may result in the withdrawal of credit.\n \nPeabody: It is the responsibility of the individual student to avoid duplication in whole or in part of the content of\nany courses offered toward the degree. Such duplication may result in the withdrawal of credit. This policy also\napplies to Advanced Placement credit.\n \nCertain courses (e.g., ensemble, performance instruction, special topics, and directed study) are designated as\nrepeatable as they contain evolving or iteratively new content. These courses may be taken multiple times for\ncredit. If a course can be repeated, the number of credits allowable per semester should not exceed 3 credit hours\nwithout permission.\nRepeated Courses (A&S, Blair, VUSE, PBDY)\nArts & Science: Most courses offered in the College of Arts and Science may be repeated. If a course was failed the\nlast time it was taken, credit is awarded when the course is repeated with a passing grade. If a course was\npreviously passed, no new credit is earned. If a course previously passed is repeated and failed, credit originally\nearned for it is lost. In any case all grades earned are shown on the transcript. Under conditions explained below, the\nmost recent grade in a course replaces the previous grade in determining credit, in computing the grade point\naverage, and in verifying the completion of degree requirements and progress toward the degree.\n \nThe policy of grade replacement applies when all of the conditions below are met.\n1. Failed courses may be repeated until passed; passed courses may be repeated only once. \n2. Exactly the same course (same department and course number) is completed. A repeated First-Year Writing\nSeminar must have the same department and section number but cannot be repeated after completion of the\nsecond semester in residence.\n3. The course is repeated on a regularly graded basis. This limitation applies even if the course was originally\ntaken on a P/F basis.\n4. The course is not one in independent study or directed study.\n5. A non-W course is taken as repeat credit for a Writing version of the same course that was previously passed.\nThe student loses credit for the writing requirement.\n6. A W course is taken as repeat credit for a non-Writing version of the same course that was previously passed.\nThe student earns credit for the writing requirement.\n7. Certain courses (e.g., ensemble, performance instruction, and independent study) are designated as\nrepeatable as they contain evolving or iteratively new content. These courses may be taken multiple times\nfor credit. If a course can be repeated, the number of credit hours allowable per semester will be included in\nthe course description.\nIn some instances, enrollment in a course similar to one already completed but with a different course number will\nresult in the award of no credit for the second course and will have no effect on the grade point average. These are\ndesignated in the departmental course listings.\n \nCourses taken in the College of Arts and Science may not be repeated elsewhere for grade replacement.\n \nStudents are cautioned that while repeating for grade replacement a course previously passed may improve their\ncumulative grade point average, it may also lead to a problem in meeting minimum credit hours requirements for\nclass standing because no new credit is earned.\n \nBlair: Certain courses, notably performing ensembles and variable credit performance instruction, may be taken\nPage 66 of 1019\nmore than once for credit. Otherwise, students may repeat any course to replace a grade, with no additional credit\nhours earned, subject to the following conditions:\nCourses taken at Vanderbilt may not be repeated elsewhere. A grade may not be replaced by a grade of\n\u201cPass.\u201d\nA grade of W or I cannot replace a letter grade.\nOnly the most recent grade is calculated in the grade point average, but all grades show on the transcript.\nEngineering: Courses in which a student has earned a grade lower than B\u2013 may be repeated under certain\nconditions. A course in which the student earned a grade between D\u2013 and C+, inclusive, may be repeated only once.\nA course may be repeated only on a graded basis, even if the course was originally taken Pass/Fail. Courses taken\nPass/Fail in which the student earned a Pass may not be repeated. A course cannot be repeated through credit by\nexamination.\n \nStudents should note that repeating a course may improve the grade point average, but it may also lead to\nproblems in meeting minimum hour requirements for class standing and progress toward a degree. Repeating a\ncourse does not increase the number of hours used in calculation of the grade point average. All grades earned will\nbe shown on the transcript, but only the latest grade will be used for computation of grade point averages.\n \nPeabody: If a course is repeated, only the last grade and credit hours earned will be used to calculate the grade\npoint average and be creditable toward graduation. However, the original grade will appear on the transcript.\nCertain courses (e.g., special topics courses, directed study courses; see duplicate content section, below) may be\nrepeated for credit when there is no duplication of content. Such courses may be repeated to replace a grade only\nwhen the content of the original and repeated courses is the same. Courses must be repeated in a graded status.\nThis policy also applies to Advanced Placement credit. Courses taken at Vanderbilt may not be repeated elsewhere\nfor grade replacement, nor may courses taken elsewhere be repeated at Vanderbilt for grade replacement.\nUndergraduate Enrollment in Graduate School Courses (A&S, Blair, VUSE, PBDY)\nArts & Science: In the 4-digit course numbering system some courses may enroll undergraduate and graduate\nstudents simultaneously. Typically, there is a 3000- or 4000-level course for undergraduates and a matching 5000-\nlevel course for graduate students. Undergraduate students may enroll in the 3000- or 4000-level course of these\npairs without special approval.\n \nA qualified Vanderbilt University senior undergraduate may enroll in courses approved for graduate credit (those\nnumbered 5000 and higher) and receive credit that, upon the student\u2019s admission to the Vanderbilt Graduate\nSchool, may be applicable toward a graduate degree. Vanderbilt cannot guarantee that another graduate school will\ngrant credit for such courses. The principles governing this option are as follows:\n1. Work taken under this option is limited to those courses approved for graduate credit (those numbered 5000\nand higher) and listed as such in the Graduate School catalog, excluding thesis and dissertation research\ncourses and similar individual research and readings courses. Courses approved for professional credit (i.e.,\nmany courses in the Divinity School, Law School, School of Medicine, School of Nursing, and Owen Graduate\nSchool of Management) may not be taken as part of this option.\n2. The student must, at the time of registration, have a 3.00 average in all prior work to be counted toward the\nbachelor\u2019s degree, or a 3.00 average in all prior work to be counted toward the undergraduate major, or a\n3.00 average in the preceding two semesters.\n3. The total course load, including both graduate and undergraduate courses, must not exceed 15 credit hours in\nany semester.\n4. No undergraduate student may enroll in more than one graduate course in any semester.\n5. A registration form for undergraduate Arts and Science students wishing to exercise this option is available in\nthe Dean\u2019s Office of Undergraduate Education. The interested student must use this form to obtain the\nwritten approval of the following:\n1. the academic adviser,\n2. the instructor of the course,\n3. and the director of graduate studies of the department or program.\nEngineering: A qualified Vanderbilt junior or senior may enroll in courses approved for graduate credit by the\ngraduate faculty. Credit from such courses may be applied to undergraduate degree requirements or, upon the\nstudent\u2019s admission to the Vanderbilt University Graduate School, toward a graduate degree. Vanderbilt cannot\nPage 67 of 1019\nguarantee that another graduate school will grant credit for such courses. The principles governing this option are\nas follows:\n1. Work taken under this option is limited to courses numbered 5000 and above and listed in the catalog of the\nGraduate School, excluding thesis and dissertation research courses and similar individual research and\nreading courses.\n2. The student must, at the time of registration, have a 3.500 grade point average in the preceding two\nsemesters.\n3. The total course load, graduate and undergraduate courses, must not exceed 18 hours in that semester.\n4. The student must obtain the written approval of their academic adviser and the instructor of the course on a\nform available in the Office of Academic Services.\n5. Permission for Vanderbilt undergraduates to enroll in graduate courses does not constitute a commitment on\nthe part of any program to accept the student as a graduate student in the future.\n6. An undergraduate student exercising this option will be treated as a graduate student with regard to class\nrequirements and grading standards.\nPeabody: All students wishing to take 5000\u20138000-level courses for either undergraduate or graduate credit must\nobtain the written approval of their academic advisers, the instructor of the course, and the Office of Academic\nServices. Some courses are designed to enroll both undergraduate and graduate/professional students in the same\nclass section. Such courses will typically have two course numbers, one in the graduate range (5000\u20138000) and one\nin the undergraduate range (usually either 3000\u2013 or 4000\u2013level). Unless they wish to take the course for post-\nbaccalaureate credit, undergraduates must register for the course using the undergraduate course number and may\ndo so without any special permission.\nUndergraduates wishing to receive approval for graduate credit in 5000\u20138000-level courses also see Reserving\nCredit for Graduate School (A&S, PBDY).\nReserving Credit for Graduate School (A&S, PBDY)\nArts & Science:\n1. Arts and Science students who are interested in reserving the credit earned in a graduate course (those\nnumbered 5000 and higher) should consult with the Graduate School before attempting to register for\ngraduate courses under this option.\n2. The work must be in excess of that required for the bachelor\u2019s degree. \n3. All of the above criteria apply under this option. \n4. Students must declare their intention to reserve this credit on the registration form.\n5. Permission for Vanderbilt undergraduates to enroll in graduate courses does not constitute a commitment on\nthe part of any department to accept the student as a graduate student in the future.\n6. An undergraduate student exercising this option is treated as a graduate student with regard to class\nrequirements and grading standards.\nPeabody: A qualified Vanderbilt University senior undergraduate may enroll in courses approved for post-\nbaccalaureate credit and receive credit which, upon the student\u2019s admission into a Peabody College professional\nprogram, may be applicable toward the professional degree. The principles governing this option are as follows:\n1. Work taken under this option is limited to those 5000\u20138000-level courses approved for post-baccalaureate\ncredit, excluding thesis and dissertation research courses and similar individual research and readings\ncourses.\n2. Such work must be in excess of that required for the bachelor\u2019s degree.\n3. At the time of registration, the student must have a B average in all prior work to be counted toward the\nbachelor\u2019s degree, or a B average in all prior work to be counted toward the undergraduate major, or\na B average in the preceding two semesters.\n4. Undergraduate students wishing to count for post-baccalaureate credit courses taken under this option must\nconsult the instructor of each course and must, at the time of registration, declare their intention on a form\navailable at the Office of Academic Services.\n5. The student\u2019s total course load (graduate plus undergraduate courses) must not exceed 15 hours during any\nsemester in which graduate credit is pursued.\n6. Permission for Vanderbilt undergraduates to enroll in post-baccalaureate courses does not constitute a\ncommitment on the part of any department to accept the student in the future. Courses taken under this\noption are subject to departmental approval before they may be included on post-baccalaureate programs of\nstudy.\n7. An undergraduate student exercising this option will be treated as a post-baccalaureate student with regard\nto class requirements and grading standards.\nPage 68 of 1019\nInterested students should consult the Peabody Office of Academic Services to verify their eligibility as defined\nabove before attempting to register for post-baccalaureate course work under this option.\nGrading and Credits\nResidence Requirement (A&S, Blair, VUSE, PBDY)\nAdvanced Placement (Blair)\nCredit Hour Definition (Blair, VUSE, PBDY)\nGrading System (A&S, Blair, VUSE, PBDY)\nGrade Reports (A&S, Blair, VUSE)\nGrade Point Average (A&S, Blair, VUSE, PBDY)\nDefined Grades with Corresponding Grade Points per Credit Hour (A&S, Blair, VUSE, PBDY)\nF: Failure (A&S, VUSE)\nGrade Appeals (PBDY)\nMid-Semester Progress Reports (A&S)\nDeficiency Notices (Blair)\nTemporary Grades (A&S, Blair, VUSE, PBDY)\nTransfer Credit (A&S, Blair, VUSE, PBDY)\nSummer or Winter Work at Another Institution (A&S)\nCredit by Examination (A&S, Blair, VUSE, PBDY)\nResidence Requirement (A&S, Blair, VUSE, PBDY)\nArts & Science: A minimum of four normal semesters (at least 60 credit hours), including the last two semesters\n(at least 30 credit hours), must be spent in residence in the College of Arts and Science unless an exception is made\nby the Administrative Committee. Students transferring from other schools of the university must spend the last\nyear (at least 30 credit hours) in residence in the College of Arts and Science.\n \nBlair: A minimum of four semesters and at least 63 credit hours, as well as the last two semesters and the last 30\ncredit hours, must be spent in residence in the Blair School. Students transferring from other schools of the\nuniversity must spend the last two semesters and at least the last 30 credit hours in residence in the Blair School.\nStudents who wish to study abroad or study away in their penultimate semester may petition the Blair Curriculum\nCommittee for a waiver of the residence requirement.\n \nEngineering: A minimum of four semesters including the last two semesters must be spent in residence in the\nSchool of Engineering. A student in the School of Engineering is considered \u201cin residence\u201d if the student is (a)\nphysically present at Vanderbilt and enrolled in Vanderbilt University classes offered on campus, or (b) enrolled in\nat least 12 credit hours in an approved Vanderbilt study abroad program. During these four or more semesters, the\nstudent must have completed at least 60 semester hours of an approved curriculum in one of the degree programs.\n \nPeabody: Students must complete a minimum of 60 hours in residence at Vanderbilt including the final two\nsemesters.\nAdvanced Placement (Blair)\nBlair: Advanced Placement with Credit. Advanced placement with credit is granted in a number of areas (see the\nchapter on Admission).\nPage 69 of 1019\nAdvanced Placement without Credit. Students may be admitted to advanced music courses on the basis of\nplacement tests at Blair, but no credit is awarded for music courses exempted.\nCredit Hour Definition (Blair, VUSE, PBDY)\nBlair/Engineering/Peabody: Credit hours are semester hours; e.g., a three-hour course carries credit of three\nsemester hours. One semester credit hour represents at least three hours of academic work per week, on average,\nfor one semester. Academic work includes, but is not necessarily limited to, lectures, laboratory work, homework,\nresearch, class readings, independent study, internships, practica, studio work, recitals, practicing, rehearsing, and\nrecitations. Some Vanderbilt courses may have requirements which exceed this definition. Certain courses (e.g.,\ndissertation research, ensemble, performance instruction, and independent study) are designated as repeatable as\nthey contain evolving or iteratively new content. These courses may be taken multiple times for credit. If a course\ncan be repeated, the number of credits allowable per semester will be included in the course description.\nGrading System (A&S, Blair, VUSE, PBDY)\nArts & Science:\n \nA: excellent\n   B: good\n   C: satisfactory\n   D: minimum pass work\n   F: failure\n \nUnder certain circumstances the following grades may be awarded:\n \n   W: withdrawal\n   P: (see P/F Course Provision)\n   M: absent from final examination\n   I: incomplete in some requirement other than final examination\n   IP: first semester grade for two-semester Honors sequence\n \nPlus and minus modifiers may be associated with letter grades A through D as shown in the table below.

Grade point\naverages are calculated using indicated grade point values.\n \nEngineering:\n \nWork is graded by letter. A, B, C, and D are considered passing grades. The grade F signifies failure. A student who\nwithdraws from a course before the date given in the Academic Calendar is given the grade W. A student may not\nwithdraw from a course after that date.\n \nPeabody:\nPeabody College undergraduate students are on a four-point grading system. All work is graded by letters,\ninterpreted as follows:\n \nA:      excellent\nB:      good\nC:      satisfactory\nD:      minimum pass work\nF:       failure\n \nUnder certain circumstances the following grades may be awarded:\n \nW:      withdrawal\nP:       pass (see Pass/D/Fail course provision)\nM:      missed final examination\nI:       incomplete in some requirement other than final examination\n \nPlus and minus modifiers may be associated with the letters A through D as shown in the table below. Grade point\naverages are calculated using indicated grade point values.\nGrade Reports (A&S, Blair, VUSE)\nArts & Science: Students have access to their grade reports on the Academic Record in YES. Notifications are sent\nPage 71 of 1019\nto students in their last two semesters, showing total credit hours, grade point average, and degree requirements\nstill to be met. Students should examine their Degree Audit carefully and discuss it with their advisers. Any errors\nshould be reported immediately to the Dean\u2019s Office of Undergraduate Education. A grade reported and recorded in\nthe Office of the University Registrar may be changed only upon request of the instructor with the approval of the\nAdministrative Committee. The committee will approve such a change only on certification that the original report\nwas in error.\n \nBlair: Grade reports and faculty critiques of performance examinations will be provided to students as soon as\npossible at the end of each semester. Grades are available online in the Academic Record, which is housed within\nYES (Your Enrollment Services) at yes.vanderbilt.edu. Occasionally, student academic information may be shared\nwith appropriate faculty committees for purposes of promotion and tenure review.\n \nA grade reported and recorded in the Office of the University Registrar may be changed only upon written request of\nthe instructor, on certification that the original report was in error, with approval of the associate dean.\n \nEngineering: A grade report will be available to the student on Academic Record in YES as soon as possible after\nthe conclusion of each semester. This report will give the total hours and grade points earned during the semester,\nas well as the cumulative hours and grade points earned through that semester. Students should examine these\nreports carefully and discuss them with their faculty advisers. Any errors should be reported immediately to the\nOffice of Academic Services of the School of Engineering.\n \nA grade reported and recorded in the Office of the University Registrar may be changed only upon written request of\nthe instructor and with approval of the Administrative Committee. The committee will approve such a change only\non certification that the original report was in error.\nGrade Point Average (A&S, Blair, VUSE, PBDY)\nArts & Science: A student\u2019s grade point average is obtained by dividing the quality points earned by the credit\nhours for which the student has registered, excluding courses taken for no credit, those from which the student has\nofficially withdrawn (see Withdrawal Period under Registration above), and those completed with the grade P.\n \nIn no case is the grade point average affected by transfer credit. No course at another institution in which a grade\nbelow C\u2013 was received, or which was taken on a Pass/Fail basis, is credited toward the degrees awarded by the\nCollege of Arts and Science.\n \nBlair: A student\u2019s grade point average is obtained by dividing the total grade points earned by the number of hours\nfor which the student registered, excluding courses audited or taken for no credit, those from which the student has\nwithdrawn or for which an incomplete grade (I or M) has been authorized, and those with the grade Pass.\n \nEngineering: A student\u2019s grade point average is obtained by dividing the total grade points earned by the number\nof hours for which the student registered, excluding courses taken for no credit, those from which the student has\nwithdrawn, those with the temporary grade of I or M, those taken in a study abroad program, and those that are\ncompleted with the grade Pass.\n \nPeabody: A student\u2019s grade point average is obtained by dividing the grade points earned by the hours for which\nthe student has registered, excluding courses taken for no credit, those from which the student has withdrawn, and\nthose that are completed with the grade P.\nDefined Grades with Corresponding Grade Points per Credit Hour (A&S, Blair, VUSE, PBDY)\nArts & Science:\nPage 72 of 1019\nA   \n4.0\nC  \n2.0\nA-  \n3.7\nC- \n1.7\nB+ \n3.3\nD+\n1.3\nB\n3.0\nD  \n1.0\nB-\n2.7\nD- \n0.7\nC+\n2.3\nF  \n0.0\n \nBlair:\nA\n4.0\nC\n2.0\nA-\n3.7\nC-\n1.7\nB+\n3.3\nD+\n1.3\nB\n3.0\nD\n1.0\nB-\n2.7\nD-\n0.7\nC+\n2.3\nF\n0.0\n \nEngineering:\n \nA+\n4.0\nC+\n2.3\nA   \n4.0\nC  \n2.0\nA-  \n3.7\nC- \n1.7\nB+ \n3.3\nD+\n1.3\nB\n3.0\nD  \n1.0\nB-\n2.7\nD- \n0.7\n \n \nF  \n0.0\n \nPeabody:\n \nA   \n4.0\nC  \n2.0\nA-  \n3.7\nC- \n1.7\nB+ \n3.3\nD+\n1.3\nB\n3.0\nD  \n1.0\nB-\n2.7\nD- \n0.7\nC+\n2.3\nF  \n0.0\nF: Failure (A&S, VUSE)\nArts & Science: The grade F indicates failure. All F\u2019s are counted in the computation of grade point averages,\nexcept when a course is repeated and is subsequently passed. In this case the latest grade is used for computation\nof the grade point average (but the grade originally earned is not removed from the transcript). A course in which\nthe grade F is received must be repeated as a regular course if credit is to be given. It may not be repeated as a\ncourse in independent or directed study, under the procedures for credit by examination, or on a P/F basis.\n \nEngineering: A subject in which the grade F is received must be taken again in class before credit is given. A\nstudent who deserts a course without following the correct procedure for withdrawing from it will receive an F in the\ncourse.\nPage 73 of 1019\nGrade Appeals (PBDY)\nPeabody: A student who believes they have received an inappropriate final grade in a class can appeal that grade\nif they believe the grade is inappropriate for at least one of the following reasons:\n1. The student is held to different standards than other students in the course.\n2. The instructor in determining the final grade applied standards that departed from those outlined in the\ncourse syllabus.\n3. The student believes that there is a clerical error in the calculation or reporting of the grade.\n4. The instructor did not adequately consider the student\u2019s needs for officially sanctioned and communicated\naccommodations.\nUltimately, the grade can be appealed following the academic appeals process outlined for more general academic\nmatters, directly above. However, several steps to attempt to resolve the grade should be taken, in turn, before an\nappeal is submitted to the Undergraduate Administrative Committee (UAC).\n \nFirst, students and instructors are encouraged to resolve grade disputes informally. If an informal process fails, the\nstudent may formally appeal a final course grade by contacting the instructor in writing within ten (10) business\ndays after the start of the following semester. The student\u2019s written appeal must include the grounds for the appeal\n(see conditions 1 through 4 listed above), the change in grade that is being requested, and evidence to support the\nstudent\u2019s case for a grade change. The instructor must inform the student of his/her decision in writing.\n \nSecond, if the student does not feel the matter has been resolved satisfactorily with the instructor, the student may\npetition the director of undergraduate studies in the department where the course is housed. The petition for\nreviewing the appeal must include the original written appeal, the instructor\u2019s written response, and the reason why\nthe student is dissatisfied with the instructor\u2019s decision. The DUS will review the materials and assess the merits of\nthe case. If the DUS finds no basis for the grievance, the petition will be dismissed and the student will be notified in\nwriting. If the DUS determines that the grievance has merit, the DUS will work with the parties to seek a resolution. If\nthe DUS is the course instructor, the student may directly petition the department chair in which the course is\nhoused.\n \nThird, if the case is dismissed by the DUS, and the student does not agree with the grounds for the decision, the\nstudent may petition the chair of the department where the course is housed. The student is responsible for\nproviding the department chair with relevant case documentation, including the original written appeal, the written\nresponses of both the instructor and the DUS, and an explanation as to why the student is dissatisfied with the DUS\u2019s\ndecision to dismiss the case. The department chair will decide the merits of the case and provide written\ndocumentation to all parties as to the decision. If the case is determined to have merit, the department chair will\nseek a resolution among the parties involved, including the student, the instructor, and the DUS. If the department\nchair is the course instructor, the student may appeal the DUS\u2019s decision directly to the Undergraduate\nAdministrative Committee using the more general academic appeals process outlined in the previous Appeals\nsection.\n \nFourth, if the case is dismissed by the department chair and the student does not agree with the grounds for the\ndecision, the student may appeal the department chair\u2019s decision to the Undergraduate Administrative Committee\nusing the more general academic appeals process outlined in the previous Appeals section.\nMid-Semester Progress Reports (A&S)\nArts & Science: At the end of the seventh week of each semester, instructors assess the progress of all students in\ntheir classes and report those whose work at that point is deficient or whose work is being harmed by excessive\nabsences. Grades to be reported are C\u2013, D+, D, D\u2013, F, and I (for incomplete, meaning that some work due by that\npoint has not been submitted). Instructors may combine with one of these grades or assign separately a notation of\nexcessive absences from a class. Reports of these deficiencies are posted in the Academic Record application in\nYES. Grades given at mid-semester do not become part of the permanent record but are intended to warn students\nabout performance judged unsatisfactory.\nDeficiency Notices (Blair)\nPage 74 of 1019\nBlair: During the week after mid-semester, the Office of the University Registrar posts deficiency notices for\nstudents whose mid-semester grade in any course is a C\u2013 or below or whose work is incomplete (I). (Deficiency\nnotices are found in the Academic Detail in YES at yes.vanderbilt.edu.) Deficiencies are issued as a matter of\ninformation and warning. Deficiencies do not show on transcripts, but information is sent to the faculty advisers and\nmay be sent to parents of those students who have submitted a FERPA Release form indicating permission to\nrelease academic information to specific individuals.\n \nA student who receives a deficiency notice is required to meet with the faculty adviser before the deadline for\nwithdrawal at the end of the week. A student with deficiencies in two or more courses or any senior who receives a\ndeficiency notice is also required to meet with the associate dean before the deadline for withdrawal (usually Friday\nof the week after mid-semester).\nTemporary Grades (A&S, Blair, VUSE, PBDY)\nArts & Science, Blair, Engineering, Peabody: Temporary grades are placeholders that are assigned under\ndefined circumstances and are not replacements for failing grades. Missing work must be completed by the deadline\nspecified by the instructor (usually before the end of the second week of classes in the next regular term but no\nlater than the end of the following semester) after which the permanent grade is recorded (either the newly\nassigned or default grade). The default grade is calculated by assigning zero points for work not submitted.\nTemporary grades are not calculated in the GPA, but a student who receives a temporary grade is ineligible for the\nDean's List. An undergraduate student cannot graduate with any temporary grades on their record.\nThe following temporary grades are available\n \nI: Incomplete\n \nTo be assigned only if the following conditions apply:\n1. An extenuating circumstance has emerged after the course withdrawal deadline\n2. The student is up to date on all work prior to the extenuating circumstance\n3. The student successfully completed at least 60% of the assigned work throughout the semester\n4. The student requests the incomplete before the end of classes\n5. The student has been attending a significant majority of the classes\n M: Missed Final Examination or Final Evaluation\n \nTo be assigned only if the following conditions apply:\n1. The student misses only the final examination or final evaluation and promptly informs the instructor as to\nthe extenuating circumstances for missing the final exam/evaluation. In the absence of prompt notification of\nextenuating circumstances, a grade of zero for the final exam/evaluation is recorded.\n2. The student could pass the course if the final examination is successfully completed. (The grade of F is given\nif the student could not pass the course even with the final examination.)\nTransfer Credit (A&S, Blair, VUSE, PBDY)\nArts & Science: It is the student\u2019s responsibility to provide all of the information required by the Office of the\nUniversity Registrar to assess the program for which transfer of credit is requested. Work presented for transfer\nmust be from a regionally accredited college and is subject to evaluation in light of the degree requirements of the\nCollege of Arts and Science. Credit will not be awarded for independent study, physical education, or dance\nperformance courses.\n \nWork transferred to Vanderbilt from another institution will not carry with it a grade point average. No course in\nwhich a grade below C\u2013 was received, or which was taken on a Pass/Fail basis, will be credited toward a degree\noffered by the College of Arts and Science. The question of credit in the College of Arts and Science for previous\nPage 75 of 1019\nwork done at another institution must be settled in advance of the student\u2019s first registration.\n \nTransfer students must spend at least four full semesters, including the last two semesters, enrolled in the College\nof Arts and Science. They must earn at least 60 credit hours and complete at least one writing course in fulfillment\nof the writing requirement while so enrolled.\n \nBlair: Transfer courses are often taken as free electives, but they may also earn liberal arts core credit. They may\nnot fulfill the music core requirements, count as part of the last 30 hours of residence, serve as repeat credit, or be\ntaken on a Pass/Fail basis. Work transferred from another institution will not carry with it a grade point average. No\ncourse in which a grade below C\u2013 was received will be credited toward the B.Mus. or B.Mus.Arts. It is the student\u2019s\nresponsibility to provide all of the information required by the Office of the University Registrar to assess the\nprogram for which transfer of credit is requested. Work presented for transfer must be from a regionally accredited\ncollege or university. Information on the evaluation process and policies is available\nat registrar.vanderbilt.edu/transfer-credit.\n \nSummer studies. Students enrolled at Blair may receive transfer credit for summer courses taken at another\nregionally accredited two-year or four-year college or university. This may include work at festivals or camps, if\noffered through a regionally accredited institution. To qualify for summer credit, a student must be in good standing,\nconsult the Office of Academic Services, and submit courses for evaluation through the Transfer Credit portal in YES.\nA detailed course syllabus is required in order for a course to be evaluated. Deadline for pre- approval is April 1.\n \nSemester work at another institution. Students wanting to receive transfer credit for a semester of work at another\nregionally accredited institution must receive approval in advance from the associate dean. To qualify for such\ncredit, the student must be in good standing and must present a plan that makes clear the educational rationale for\nsuch work, the ways in which it supplements the Vanderbilt curriculum, and the equivalence of standards to those at\nVanderbilt. Approval of the overall plan must be followed by approval of specific courses by the associate dean and\nsubmission of courses through the transfer credit evaluation process in YES. A detailed course syllabus is required in\norder for a course to be evaluated. Students enrolled full time (i.e., carrying at least 12 credit hours) during a regular\n(fall or spring) semester are assumed to be engaged in full-time study at Vanderbilt. Such students are not\npermitted to take additional course work elsewhere, for transfer credit, during the semester. This includes online  \ncourses as well as courses offered by nearby institutions.\n \nEngineering: Work that a student contemplates taking at a college or university other than Vanderbilt after\nmatriculating to VU is treated as transfer work and must be approved in advance in writing through the YES Transfer\nCredit application. The institution must have appropriate regional accreditation. It is the student\u2019s responsibility to\nprovide all information needed for an assessment of the program and course(s) for which transfer credit is\nrequested. Students must upload a detailed syllabus, which then must be approved by the Office of the University\nRegistrar, the relevant Vanderbilt University department, and the School of Engineering Dean\u2019s Office. Work\ntransferred to Vanderbilt from another institution will not be included in the Vanderbilt grade point average. No\ntransfer credit course in which a grade below C- was earned or that was taken after the start of the penultimate\nVanderbilt semester will be credited toward a degree offered by the School of Engineering. A course a student has\ntaken at Vanderbilt may not be repeated in another institution to obtain a higher grade or to obtain credit. Students\nwho have been dismissed from Vanderbilt and subsequently return to Vanderbilt are not eligible to receive transfer\ncredit for any classes taken during the period of dismissal. Students cannot take courses for transfer credit at or\nthrough another institution while simultaneously enrolled in a semester at Vanderbilt unless authorized in advance\nby the School\u2019s Administrative Committee.\n \nPeabody: Students who transfer from another institution must have a final transcript sent directly to the\nUndergraduate Admissions Office, Vanderbilt University. Upon acceptance, students will be asked to submit course\ndescriptions and syllabi for all proposed transfer credit. Upon acceptance, courses will be evaluated by Vanderbilt to\ndetermine which courses will transfer and which requirements (e.g., Liberal Education Core, professional core) are\nmet by the transfer courses. No course for which a student received the grade D+ or lower will transfer. Course\nwork transferred to Vanderbilt from another institution will not carry with it a grade point average.\nPage 76 of 1019\nTransfer students must complete at least 60 hours of work at Vanderbilt. Two of the four semesters in residence\nmust be the last two semesters of the student\u2019s degree program.\n \nPeabody students who wish to take course work during the summer, or during an academic-year semester, at a\nregionally accredited two-year or four-year college or university and transfer up to 12 hours to Vanderbilt must be in\ngood standing with at least a C average. Prior approval must be granted for all courses to be taken elsewhere. If the\ncourses are to be taken during the academic year, the student must take a personal leave explicitly approved for\nthis purpose by the Peabody Dean\u2019s Office. Students on leave for other reasons (e.g., medical or other personal\nreasons) cannot take course work elsewhere for transfer credit without prior permission. Course work transferred to\nVanderbilt from another institution will not carry with it a grade point average.\n \nRequests to participate in non-Vanderbilt-approved overseas programs for transfer credit will be approved only\nunder exceptional circumstances in which the proposed program represents a truly unique and unusual educational\nopportunity. To apply for approval, the student should complete the transfer of credit application and apply for a\nleave of absence for the relevant semester. The student must be in good standing with at least a 2.700 grade point\naverage as of the date of application, and approval must be granted in advance of the study overseas. Petitions for\nleaves of this type must be filed at least one month before the close of the preceding semester, and final approval\nof such petitions always rests with the dean\u2019s office. It should be noted, however, that if a program has been\napproved by Vanderbilt, students must enroll in the program via the Global Education Office. In no case, after\nmatriculating at Vanderbilt, may a student apply to participate in an approved program for transfer credit through a\ndifferent university, or through an external agency, and then seek to transfer that credit into Vanderbilt.\n \nStudents enrolled full time (i.e., carrying at least 12 credit hours) during a regular (fall or spring) semester are\nassumed to be engaged in full-time study at Vanderbilt. Such students are not permitted to take additional course\nwork elsewhere, for transfer credit, during the semester. This includes online courses, as well as courses offered by\nnearby institutions.\nSummer or Winter Work at Another Institution (A&S)\nArts & Science: Students enrolled in the College of Arts and Science may receive transfer credit for a maximum of\ntwo courses taken during summer or winter at a regionally-accredited institution. To qualify for such credit, the\nstudent must be in good academic standing and must obtain prior authorization from the appropriate department\nby submitting courses through the Transfer Credit Submission application in YES. A detailed course syllabus is\nrequired in order for a course to be evaluated. Such courses cannot fulfill AXLE requirements, count as part of the\nlast 30 credit hours in residence, duplicate a course taken previously, or be taken on a Pass/Fail or similar basis.\nStudents cannot transfer credit for summer or winter work from outside of the country of their permanent home\naddress.\nCredit by Examination (A&S, Blair, VUSE, PBDY)\nArts & Science: In certain circumstances, students may be awarded course credit by departmental examination.\n(This procedure is distinct from the award of credit through the College Board Advanced Placement Tests taken prior\nto the student\u2019s first enrollment.)\n \nStudents who wish to earn credit by departmental examination should consult the Dean\u2019s Office of Undergraduate\nEducation in Arts and Science concerning procedures. To be eligible, students must be carrying a minimum of 12\ncredit hours and be in good standing.\n \nStudents must obtain the approval of the chair of the department that is to give the examination and the instructor\ndesignated by the chair. Students may earn up to 18 hours of credit by any combination of credit through advanced\nplacement examinations and credit by departmental examination. Students may earn up to 8 hours of credit by\nexamination in any one department. Students may attempt to obtain credit by examination no more than twice in\none semester, no more than once in one course in one semester, and no more than twice in one course. Students\nmay not repeat a course for grade replacement under the credit by examination procedures. Credits earned by\nPage 77 of 1019\ncredit by examination may not be counted toward AXLE.\n \nCredit hours and grade are awarded on the basis of the grade earned on the examination, subject to the policy of\nthe department awarding credit. Students have the option of refusing to accept the credit hours and grade after\nlearning the results of the examination.\n \nStudents enrolled for at least 12 credit hours are not charged extra tuition for hours earned through credit by\nexamination, so long as the amount of credit falls within the allowable limits of an 18-hour tuition load, including no-\ncredit courses and courses dropped after the Change Period. Students in this category must pay a $50 fee for the\ncost of constructing, administering, and grading the examination. Since this cost has already been incurred,\nstudents who refuse the credit hours and grade are charged the $50 fee nevertheless.\n \nFull-time students with a tuition load exceeding 18 credit hours and students taking fewer than 12 credit hours pay\ntuition at the regular rate with no additional fee.\n \nBlair: In certain circumstances, students may be awarded course credit (a maximum of 8 hours) by departmental\nexamination. This procedure is distinct from the awarding of credit through the College Board Advanced Placement\nTests or the International Baccalaureate. Students apply for credit by examination through the Blair Office of\nAcademic Services.\n \nTo earn credit by departmental examination, students must be enrolled for at least 12 hours, be in good standing,\nbe recommended by their advisers, and have the approval of the appropriate department. In addition, students\nmust seek prior approval of their study plan through the associate dean\u2019s office. Students may attempt to earn\ncredit by examination in no more than two courses in one semester, only once in any course in one semester, and\nno more than twice in the same course.\n \nCredit hours and grade are awarded on the basis of the grade earned on the examination, subject to the policy of\nthe department awarding credit. Students have the option of refusing to accept the credit hours and grade after\nlearning the results of the examination.\n \nStudents enrolled for at least 12 hours are not charged extra tuition for hours earned through credit by examination,\nso long as the amount of credit falls within the allowable limits of an 18-hour tuition load, including no-credit courses\nand courses dropped after the change period. Students in this category must pay a $50 fee for the cost of\nconstructing, administering, and grading the examination. Since this cost has already been incurred, students who\nrefuse the credit hours and grade are charged the $50 fee nevertheless. Full-time students with a tuition load\nexceeding 18 hours and students taking fewer than 12 hours pay tuition at the regular rate, per credit hour, with no\nadditional fee.\n \nEngineering: In certain circumstances students may be awarded course credit by departmental examination. (This\nprocedure is distinct from the award of credit through the College Board Advanced Placement or International\nBaccalaureate Examinations, taken prior to a student\u2019s first enrollment at Vanderbilt or another college.)\n \nStudents who want to earn credit by departmental examination should consult the associate dean concerning\nprocedures. To be eligible, students must be in good standing.\n \nStudents must obtain the approval of the chair of the department that is to give the examination and of the\ninstructor designated by the chair. Students may earn up to 8 hours of credit by examination in any one\ndepartment, although this limitation might be raised on approval of the Administrative Committee. Students may\nPage 78 of 1019\nattempt to obtain credit by examination no more than twice in one semester, no more than once in one course in\none semester, and no more than twice in one course.\n \nCredit hours and grade are awarded on the basis of the grade earned on the examination, subject to the policy of\nthe department awarding credit.

If graduation requirements\nchange during the time students are in school, they may elect to be bound by the requirements published in the\ncatalog in any year during their undergraduate academic career at Vanderbilt.\nGrade Point Average Requirements (VUSE)\nEngineering: To be eligible for graduation, a student must have successfully completed all degree requirements\nand shall have earned a minimum grade point average of 2.000 in (a) all courses taken, (b) courses taken within the\nSchool of Engineering, and (c) department courses of each major.\nGraduation Requirements (Blair, VUSE, PBDY)\nBlair: Candidates for degrees must have completed 126 hours and all curriculum requirements, have passed all\nprescribed examinations, and be free of indebtedness to the university.\n \nExceptions to stated degree requirements and procedures must be approved by the Curriculum Committee as the\nrepresentative body of the faculty in matters pertaining to the curriculum.\n \nThe minimum grade point averages required for graduation are 2.0 overall and 2.0 in music. A student taking a\nsecond major must earn a 2.0 in that major in order for it to be certified on the transcript.\n \nIf requirements for graduation change, students may elect to be bound by requirements published in\nthe Undergraduate Catalog in either their entering or their graduating year.\n \nEngineering: The specific course requirements and total hours required for the bachelor\u2019s degree vary with the\nstudent\u2019s major program. Detailed requirements for each program are shown in the specimen curricula in the\nCourses of Study section.\n \nPeabody: The specific course requirements and total hours required for the bachelor\u2019s degree vary with the\nstudent\u2019s major program. Detailed requirements for each program are shown in the specimen curricula in the\nCourses of Study section.\nScholarship Student Requirements (Blair, VUSE)\nBlair: Students receiving honor scholarships through Blair School of Music must be enrolled full time, taking all\nassigned music courses, must qualify for class standing, and must maintain each semester minimum grade point\naverages of 2.0 overall and 2.7 in music. Students receiving the Cornelius Vanderbilt Honor Scholarship must\nmaintain a minimum 3.0 grade point average overall and 3.0 in music each year. Additional requirements may be\nstipulated in scholarship award letters.\n \nHonor scholarship awards are considered for renewal annually. Student work will be reviewed at the end of spring\nsemester for possible renewal for the following academic year. Temporary grades may adversely affect renewal. A\nstudent who falls short of the requirements will normally have the scholarship for one semester of grace, after\nwhich, if requirements are still not met, the scholarship will be lost.\nPage 80 of 1019\nStudents receiving scholarships or grants as part of their financial aid packages (not honor scholarships) must\nqualify for class standing in order to be considered for renewal each year. Students receiving federal aid are\nexpected to make satisfactory academic progress as outlined in the chapter on Financial Information.\n \nEngineering: Those students having honor scholarships are expected to maintain a 3.000 grade point average\nwhile taking a minimum of 12 hours. Failure to maintain a 3.000 grade point average each year will result in the\ncancellation of the scholarship.\nLiberal Education Core Guidelines (PBDY)\nPeabody: Applicants to Peabody College will be required to take the SAT I or ACT writing test and the SAT II\nmathematics test. Students with majors in human and organizational development, cognitive studies, child studies,\nor child development do not need the SAT II mathematics test. For applicants applying for Fall 2022 entry,\nVanderbilt is test optional. Scores from the ACT or SAT are not required to be considered for admission. Applicants\nwho want their test scores to be considered may self-report them on the application or may have official scores sent\nto Vanderbilt by the testing agency. Official test scores are required for students who applied with testing and who\nwere admitted and enroll.\n \nThe following application of these scores will be made to the Peabody Liberal Education Core:\n \nWriting Requirement\n \nBefore graduation, all Peabody students must successfully complete two writing courses and credit for the ENGL\n1100s. Writing-intensive courses either have a \u201cW\u201d after the course number (A&S courses) or end with the digit \"7\"\n(Peabody courses).\n \nTo earn credit for ENGL 1100, students must complete one of the following:\nEnglish 1100 \nSAT: Combined score of at least 1220 on the Writing and Critical Reasoning sections, with a minimum score of\n500 on each (test taken prior to March 2016).\nSAT: Score of at least 660 on the Evidence-Based Reading and Writing section, with a minimum score of 27\non the Reading section and a minimum score of 28 on the Writing and Language section (test taken March\n2016 or later).\nACT: Score of at least 27 on the English portion combined with a minimum score of 7 on the Writing portion\n(test taken prior to September 2015).\nACT: Score of at least 27 on the English portion combined with a minimum score of 19 on the Writing portion\n(test taken between September 2015 and September 2016).\nACT: Score of at least 30 on the English portion.\nAP: Minimum score of 4 on the English Language or English Literature exam.\nIB: Minimum score of 6 on the Higher level English A Literature or the Higher Level English A Language &\nLiterature exam.\nMinimum score of 62 on the Tailwind Writing Skill and Reading Comprehension Proficiency Exam.\nFirst-year seminars (courses labeled 1111) offered through the College of Arts and Science and Blair School of Music\nmay count as writing-intensive courses. Peabody freshmen may register for first-year seminars when open\nregistration begins if there are available seats in the course not reserved for Arts and Science students or Blair\nstudents. Peabody students are not required to take a First-year Writing Seminar.\n \nMathematics\n \nPage 81 of 1019\nStudents with first majors in elementary, secondary, or special education with an SAT II Mathematics test score at or\nabove 620 (Level I) or at or above 570 (Level II) are exempt from three hours of the math component of the Liberal\nEducation Core mathematics category. Students with an exemption must take an additional three credit hours in\ntheir Liberal Education Core elective category to have the minimum required sixty-hour core. Students must take a\nstatistics course if required for their major.\n \nStudents with first majors in child development, child studies, cognitive studies, or human and organizational\ndevelopment must take six hours as stated in the Liberal Education Core mathematics category.\nProgress Evaluation (PBDY)\nPeabody: Students enrolled in Peabody College are expected to satisfy most Liberal Education Core requirements\nduring the freshman and sophomore years. Although legitimate circumstances sometimes force the postponement\nof Liberal Education Core requirements, upper-level students are not expected to have a significant number of\nLiberal Education Core requirements outstanding. A student who, in the opinion of the faculty adviser, the\ndepartment chair, or the associate dean for undergraduate academic affairs, is not making satisfactory progress\ntoward meeting Liberal Education Core or other degree requirements may be reported to the Undergraduate\nAdministrative Committee and is subject to being placed on academic probation by that committee. Students placed\non academic probation for failure to make satisfactory progress toward a degree must remove the deficiency in the\nmanner specified by the Administrative Committee.\nWriting Portfolio (Blair)\nBlair: Students in their senior year are required to submit a writing portfolio drawn from academic course work from\none or more classes to be evaluated by a faculty committee. Emphasis should be placed on demonstrating an\nability to write clearly and effectively and on the student\u2019s ability to form connections across two or more\ndisciplines. Students are required to prepare a one-paragraph narrative explaining how the submitted work\ndemonstrates the required competencies.\nDegree Audit Reports (Blair)\nBlair: An online degree audit is available on YES to all Blair students, showing total hours earned, degree\nrequirements completed, and those still to be met. Students should examine the audit carefully with their faculty\nadvisers. Problems or suspected errors should be discussed immediately with the Blair Office of Academic Services.\nDeclaring of Major and of Second Major (PBDY)\nPeabody: Peabody students declare a major as part of the application process prior to admission. In their first\nsemester, Peabody freshmen are expected to take course work recommended for the major into which they were\nadmitted. Students wishing to change into a different major within Peabody cannot declare this change until March\nof their first year. Second majors must be declared no later than the second semester of the sophomore year. Also,\nduring the sophomore year, students majoring in secondary education and special education will be required to\ndeclare their area of specialization or track.\nOverlap in Course Work between Multiple Majors and Minors (PBDY)\nPeabody: Students pursuing multiple majors and/or optional minors are limited in the amount of course work that\ncan be shared across their major and minor programs of study. If the major or minor is offered through a school\nother than Peabody, the amount of course work that can be shared between that major or minor and other majors or\nminors is determined by that school\u2019s policies. For a major offered through Peabody College, at least 21 credit hours\nneed to be unique to that major. That is, 21 hours within the major cannot be used to count toward any other major\nor minor. For a minor offered through Peabody College, at least 15 hours need to be unique to that minor. Students\nin the School of Engineering may use courses taken in Peabody College for relevant second majors even if those\ncourses also fulfill a School of Engineering degree requirement.\nClass Standing (A&S, Blair, VUSE, PBDY)\nArts & Science: The Administrative Committee determines how many semesters will be allowed for each part-time\nstudent to attain sophomore, junior, or senior standing.\n \nPage 82 of 1019\nThe internal record of a student dropped from the university under these regulations shows the notation \u201cFailed to\nqualify for class standing.\u201d\n \nSophomore Standing\n \nA student qualifies for sophomore standing upon completion of 24 credit hours of work with a grade point average of\nat least 1.800, completion of two regular semesters (fall or spring), and completion of the first-year writing\nrequirement: successful completion of English 1100 if required and successful completion of a First-Year Writing\nSeminar (numbered 1111 in various disciplines). First-year students who fail to qualify for sophomore standing in\ntwo semesters are placed on probation and must have the permission of the Administrative Committee to register\nfor a third semester. The third semester must be the summer semester at Vanderbilt. Normally, students who do\nnot qualify for sophomore standing during this third semester are dropped from the university.\n \nJunior Standing\n \nA student qualifies for junior standing upon completion of 54 credit hours of work with a grade point average of\n1.900, completion of four regular semesters (fall or spring), and completion of a W course at any level (other than\nENGL 1100 or a First-Year Writing Seminar). Sophomores who fail to qualify for junior standing within two semesters\nafter qualifying for sophomore standing are placed on probation and must have the permission of the Administrative\nCommittee to register for another semester. This additional semester must be the summer semester at Vanderbilt.\nNormally, students who do not qualify for junior standing in this additional semester are dropped from the\nuniversity.\n \nSenior Standing\n \nA student qualifies for senior standing upon completion of 84 credit hours of work with a grade point average of\n2.000 and completion of six regular semesters (fall or spring). Juniors who fail to qualify for senior standing within\ntwo semesters after qualifying for junior standing are placed on probation and must have the permission of the\nAdministrative Committee to register for another semester. This additional semester must be the summer semester\nat Vanderbilt. Normally, students who do not qualify for senior standing in this additional semester are dropped\nfrom the university.\n \nSeniors who fail to maintain a minimum grade point average of 2.000 are placed on probation and must have the\npermission of the Administrative Committee to register for another semester.\n \nBlair: To qualify for sophomore standing, a student must complete a minimum of 24 hours with a grade point\naverage of 1.8 and have completed two regular semesters.\n \nTo qualify for junior standing, a student must complete a minimum of 54 hours with a grade point average of 1.9,\nmust complete MUTH 2200 and MUTH 2220, and must have completed four regular semesters.\n \nTo qualify for senior standing, a student must complete a minimum of 86 hours with a grade point average of 2.0\nand have completed six regular semesters.\n \nEngineering: School of Engineering students are promoted on the basis of cumulative GPA, hours earned, and\nregular semesters in residence. For the purposes of promotion, a regular semester is defined as any fall or spring\nPage 83 of 1019\nterm in which a student is enrolled at Vanderbilt University. Test credit and transfer credit can be used to satisfy the\ncredit hour requirement.\n \nVUSE Promotion Standards \nClass\nStanding\nGPA Requirement\nCredit Hour Requirement\nMinimum Residence\nRequirement\nSophomore\n1.80\n24 hours earned\n2 regular semesters\nJunior\n1.90\n54 hours earned\n4 regular semesters\nSenior\n2.00\n86 hours earned\n6 regular semesters\n \nPeabody: To qualify for sophomore standing, a freshman must earn at least 24 hours with a grade point average of\nat least 1.800 and have completed two regular semesters. A freshman who fails to achieve sophomore standing at\nthe end of two regular semesters is placed on probation and has one additional semester in which to qualify for\nsophomore standing. This additional semester must be the summer session at Vanderbilt. Normally, students who\nfail to qualify for sophomore standing in the third semester are dropped from the university.\n \nA student qualifies for junior standing by earning 54 hours with a grade point average of at least 1.900 and having\ncompleted four regular semesters. Students who fail to qualify for junior standing at the end of two semesters after\nqualifying for sophomore standing are placed on probation and must qualify in an additional semester. This third\nsemester must be the summer session at Vanderbilt. Normally, students who do not qualify for junior standing in\nthis additional semester will be dropped from the university.\n \nA student qualifies for senior standing by earning 84 hours with a grade point average of at least 2.000 and having\ncompleted six regular semesters. A student who fails to qualify for senior standing within two semesters of\nqualifying for junior standing will be placed on probation and must qualify in one additional semester. This additional\nsemester must be the summer session at Vanderbilt. Normally, students who do not qualify for senior standing in\nthis additional semester will be dropped from the university.\nSenior in Absentia (A&S)\nArts & Science: A student who wishes to earn a baccalaureate degree in the College of Arts and Science in\nabsentia must have (a) completed the AXLE requirements and all major requirements; (b) earned at least 105 credit\nhours and a grade point average of 2.000 with at least 60 credit hours earned in a minimum of four semesters of\nresidence in the College of Arts and Science; (c) been accepted at a professional or graduate school where, during\nthe first year, the remaining credit hours needed for graduation can be earned; and (d) obtained the approval of the\nmajor department and an associate dean of the College of Arts and Science. Students who have completed fewer\nthan 105 credit hours may petition the Administrative Committee for special consideration.\n \nThe limitation on credit hours outside the College of Arts and Science applies to all bachelor of arts candidates.\n \nStudents in the senior-in-absentia program pay a minimum semester tuition charge to the College of Arts and\nScience (see Financial Information).\nExaminations\nExaminations (A&S, Blair, VUSE)\nArts & Science: Each department establishes procedures for evaluating student performance, and normally the\nmethod of evaluation is the responsibility of the course instructor. At the beginning of the semester instructors\nshould clearly state the evaluation procedures, including types of examinations, to be used in their courses.\nStudents should have adequate opportunity during the semester to demonstrate their knowledge of the subject\nmatter and should be given an indication of their progress in the course prior to the deadline for dropping courses.\nPage 84 of 1019\nInstructors are cautioned against placing excessive weight on the final examination when determining a student\u2019s\ngrade in a course.\n \nBlair: All examinations are conducted under the honor system. Primary and alternate exam schedules, which allow\ntwo hours for a final exam in each course, are listed on the University Registrar's website. The instructor may use\nthe alternate schedule in addition to, but not instead of, the primary schedule.\n \nAlternatives to standard in-class final examinations, such as term papers or take-home, self-scheduled, or oral\nexaminations may be given at the instructor\u2019s discretion. A take-home exam is distributed at the last regular class\nmeeting and must be completed by the latest time scheduled for the final examination.\n \nPerformance examinations are scheduled by area coordinators. Students giving full recitals during the semester\nmay be exempted from performance examinations at the discretion of the instructor. If performance examinations\nare scheduled on a reading day (the day after classes end, when no course examinations are scheduled), students\nare also given the choice of a different day for their performance examinations.\n \nA student who misses a final examination may be eligible to receive the grade M (see Temporary Grades).\n \nEngineering: Examinations are usually given at the end of each semester. Exams will be no longer than three\nhours in length and are given according to the schedule published in the Final Examination Schedule. The School of\nEngineering does not offer an alternate examination schedule. All examinations are conducted under the honor\nsystem. Students must be present for all their scheduled final exams or otherwise will default on their exams.\nDead Week (A&S, Blair, PBDY)\nArts & Science: No examinations of any type\u2014including quizzes, hour examinations, and portions of final\nexaminations\u2014are allowed during the last week of classes; papers and in-class presentations are permitted during\ndead week. The Administrative Committee may grant special permission to the instructor in charge of a course to\ngive laboratory examinations during the last regular laboratory period of the last week of classes. The last week of\nclasses is defined as the last seven calendar days preceding the end of classes. If, for example, classes end on\nTuesday, then the \u201cdead week\u201d begins the preceding Wednesday and lasts through Tuesday. Students should notify\nthe Dean\u2019s Office of Undergraduate Education of any violation.\n \nBlair: The last week of classes, i.e., the last seven calendar days before the final examination period each semester,\nis designated as dead week. No examinations of any type, including quizzes, portions of final examinations, recitals,\nor ensemble performances, may be given during this time without the express written permission of the dean and\nnotification of students at least two weeks before dead week. Violations should be reported to the dean.\n \nPeabody: Because Peabody classes integrate theory and practice, many courses include significant semester-long\ngroup and individual projects that culminate in papers, presentations, simulations, or other activities at the end of\nthe semester. Therefore, while instructors are discouraged from scheduling quizzes, tests, or short-term\nassignments for the last week of the semester, Peabody\u2019s \u201cdead week\u201d policy does not prohibit assignments during\nthe week before finals.\nFinal Examinations (A&S)\nArts & Science: The primary and alternate final examination schedules issued each semester allow two hours for a\nfinal examination in each course. Each in-class final examination must be given at the time indicated on the primary\nschedule. The alternate schedule is used only if the instructor decides to give an in-class examination at two times.\nThe final examination period lasts for about a week and a half.\n \nPage 85 of 1019\nAlternatives to the standard in-class final examination are permitted at the instructor\u2019s discretion. Some examples\nare take-home examinations, oral examinations, and term papers; there need not be a final examination if\nadequate evaluation procedures have been used during the term. A take-home or oral examination should make\napproximately the same demand on a student\u2019s time as an in-class examination and should be conducted during\nthe final examination period. A take-home examination must be distributed at the last regular class meeting and\nmust be completed by either the primary or the alternate examination date, whichever is later.\n \nAll examinations are conducted under the Honor System.\n \nThe instructor\u2019s record of grades given during a course and any final examination papers not returned to students\nmust be kept on file by the instructor for the first month of the semester following the conclusion of the course. For\nspring semester and summer session courses, this rule means the first month of the fall semester.\n \nMonitoring these regulations is the responsibility of the departments, under the supervision of the Dean\u2019s Office of\nUndergraduate Education. Variations from the regulations\u2014such as changing the time of an in-class final\nexamination for an entire class\u2014are allowed only on approval of the Administrative Committee.\nComprehensive Examinations (A&S)\nArts & Science: Any department or interdisciplinary program may require a comprehensive examination of its\nmajor students as a condition of graduation.\nSenior Re-Examination (A&S, Blair, VUSE, PBDY)\nArts & Science: A candidate for graduation who fails not more than one course in the final semester may be\nallowed one re- examination, provided the course failed prevents the student\u2019s graduation, and provided the student\ncould pass the course by passing a re-examination. Certain courses may be excluded from re-examination. The re-\nexamination must be requested through the Dean\u2019s Office of Undergraduate Education, and if approved, it is given\nimmediately after the close of the last semester of the student\u2019s senior year. A student who passes the re-\nexamination will receive a D\u2013 in the course. The terms and administration of senior re-examination are the\nresponsibility of the school that offers the course.\n \nBlair: A candidate for graduation who fails not more than one course in the final semester may be allowed one re-\nexamination, provided the course failed would prevent the student\u2019s graduation, and provided the student could\npass the course by passing a re-examination. Certain courses may be excluded from re-examination. The re-\nexamination must   be requested through the student\u2019s associate dean\u2019s office, and, if approved, it is given\nimmediately after the close of the last semester of the student\u2019s senior year. A student who passes the re-\nexamination will receive a D- in the course. The terms and administration of senior re-examination are the\nresponsibility of the school that offers the course. Note: For engineering students taking engineering courses, the\nsenior re-examination policy applies if a student fails not more than one course in the senior year.\n \nEngineering: A candidate for graduation who fails not more than one course in the final semester may be allowed\none re-examination, provided the course failed prevents the student\u2019s graduation, and provided the student could\npass the course by passing a re-examination. Certain courses may be excluded from re-examination. The re-\nexamination must be requested through the student\u2019s Dean\u2019s Office, and, if approved, it is given immediately after\nthe close of the last semester of the student\u2019s senior year. A student who passes the re-examination will receive\na D- in the course. The terms and administration of senior re-examination are the responsibility of the school that\noffers the course. For engineering students, this senior re-examination policy applies if a student fails a course in\nthe final semester or fails a course in the penultimate semester that is not offered in the final semester, provided\nthat failure in that one course is the only thing preventing the student\u2019s graduation.\n \nPeabody: A candidate for graduation who fails not more than one course in the final semester may be allowed one\nre-examination, provided the course failed prevents the student\u2019s graduation, and provided the student could pass\nthe course by passing a re-examination. Certain courses may be excluded from re-examination.\nPage 86 of 1019\nThe re-examination must be requested through the Office of the Associate Deans, and if approved, it is given\nimmediately after the close of the last semester of the student\u2019s senior year. A student who passes the re-\nexamination will receive a D\u2013 in the course. The terms and administration of senior re-examination are the\nresponsibility of the school that offers the course.\nAcademic Standards & Discipline\nAcademic Standing (VUSE)\nEngineering:\n \nGood Standing\n \nTo remain in good academic standing, a student must pursue a program leading toward a degree in the School of\nEngineering and meet all GPA and hours earned requirements at the conclusion of each fall and spring semester. A\nfirst-year student must successfully complete at least 12 hours and earn at least a 1.8 semester GPA each semester\nto remain in good standing. A sophomore, junior, or senior must complete at least 12 hours and earn at least a 2.0\nsemester GPA each semester to remain in good standing. In addition, a student must also promote to the next\nacademic class every two regular semesters according to the VUSE promotion standards (above) to remain in good\nstanding.\n \nProbation\n \nStudents who fail to meet the GPA, hours earned, or class standing promotion standards required to remain in good\nstanding will be placed on academic probation. Students who are not progressing toward a degree in the School of\nEngineering may be placed on academic probation. Students who fail to return to good standing after a semester on\nprobation will be continued on probation or dismissed. Students who are on probation for three semesters risk\ndismissal.\n \nA student authorized by the Administrative Committee to carry fewer than 12 hours because of illness or for some\nother approved reason may be placed on probation if the student\u2019s work is deemed unsatisfactory.\n \nRequired Leave of Absence\n \nUnder certain circumstances, a student may be required to take a semester-long leave of absence from the\nuniversity. Such a leave may be required for students for whom one or more of the following conditions apply:\nFailing to pass 6 or more credit hours in a semester;\nEarning a semester grade point average of 1.4 or less; or\nFailing to improve academic achievement while on probation.\nDismissal\n \nAny student who is deemed by the Administrative Committee not to be making satisfactory progress toward a\ndegree in engineering will be dismissed from the School of Engineering and from Vanderbilt University. Satisfactory\nprogress includes completing required courses in a timely manner and maintaining a 2.000 GPA in all courses, in the\nschool, and in the student\u2019s major. Causes of dismissal include:\nFailure of all courses in any semester\nPage 87 of 1019\nThree or more semesters on probation\nFailure to promote to the next class standing after three semesters\nFailure to progress toward a degree in the School of Engineering\nDismissed students are eligible to apply for reinstatement to the School of Engineering and to Vanderbilt University\nafter one calendar year. The reinstatement process is outlined at registrar.vanderbilt.edu/reinstatement. Students\nwho are dismissed and later apply for reinstatement are ineligible to receive transfer credit for courses taken while\ndismissed.\nSudden Academic Insufficiency (Blair, PBDY)\nBlair: Any student who fails by a wide margin to reach prescribed levels of academic achievement, either at the end\nof a semester or at mid-semester, is reviewed by the associate dean\u2019s office in conjunction with the academic and\nstudio adviser(s). If the student is not making satisfactory progress towards the degree, the student may be placed\non probation or may be advised or required to take a leave of absence or advised to withdraw from the university.\n \nAppeals of such findings should be addressed to the Blair Curriculum Committee.\n \nPeabody: Any student who fails by a wide margin to reach prescribed levels of academic achievement, either at\nthe end of a semester or at mid-semester, or who has been placed on probation more than once is reviewed by the\nPeabody Undergraduate Administrative Committee. The Committee considers each case within the general\nguidelines for maintenance of satisfactory academic standing and may take any of several actions, among which are\nthe following:\nThe student may be placed on probation;\nThe student may be advised to take a leave of absence or to withdraw from the university;\nThe student may be required to take an academic probationary leave of absence;\nThe student may be dismissed from the university.\nUnder certain circumstances, a student who has been formally dismissed may be readmitted to Peabody. The\nPeabody Undergraduate Administrative Committee must review and approve any request for readmission.\nAcademic Discipline (A&S)\nArts & Sciences: The College of Arts and Science requires each student to maintain an academic record that will\npermit graduation according to a specified schedule. Students are considered to fall short of the expected rate of\nprogress when\n1. They pass fewer than 12 credit hours in a semester or have a semester grade point average lower than\n1.500; or\n2. In a summer they take 12 or more credit hours but pass fewer than 12 credit hours or earn a grade point\naverage lower than 1.500; or\n3. They fail to achieve sophomore, junior, or senior standing within the time allowed; or\n4. They accumulate more than two probations after the freshman year, in which case they will normally be\ndropped from the university; or\n5. As first-semester freshmen they pass fewer than two courses or earn a semester grade point average lower\nthan 1.000, in which case they may be required to take a probationary leave of absence; or\n6. As first-semester freshmen they earn fewer than 9 credit hours or a semester grade point average lower than\n1.500, in which case they may be offered a choice (see Semester Requirements below).\nAny student who falls somewhat short of the prescribed levels of academic achievement is normally placed on\nprobation. Any student who fails by a wide margin to reach these levels or who has been placed on probation more\nthan once is reviewed by the Administrative Committee, and may be dropped from the university without having\npreviously been placed on academic probation. The committee considers each case within the framework of the\nguidelines  outlined below and may take any of several actions, among which are the following:\n1. The student may be placed on probation;\n2. The student may be advised to take a leave of absence or to withdraw from the university;\n3. The student may be required to take a leave of absence;\n4. The student may be dropped from the university.\nSemester Requirements (A&S)\nPage 88 of 1019\nArts & Science: Full-time students are expected to earn each semester at least 12 credit hours and a minimum\ngrade point average of 1.500. Students who fall short of these levels are normally placed on probation. Students are\nremoved from probation after earning at least 12 credit hours and a semester grade point average of 1.500 or\nbetter, assuming they have fulfilled the requirements for class standing stated below.\n \nFirst-year students who pass fewer than two regular courses in their first regular semester or who earn a semester\ngrade point average lower than 1.000 have so seriously compromised their academic standing that they may be\nrequired to take a probationary leave of absence until the beginning of the following fall semester.\n \nFirst-year students who earn fewer than 9 credit hours or a grade point average lower than 1.500 in the fall may, at\nthe discretion of the Administrative Committee, choose a probationary leave for the spring and return the next fall\nwith two semesters in which to qualify for sophomore standing.\n \nA student on probationary leave may not earn credit at another institution for transfer to Vanderbilt. In appropriate\ncases the Administrative Committee may prescribe conditions that must be satisfied before the student returns from\na probationary leave. Students who do not choose to return at the end of a probationary leave but want to return\nlater are required to apply for reinstatement.\n \nAfter their first year, full-time students may not be placed on probation more than twice (continuance on probation\nfor a second semester counts as another probation). If a student\u2019s performance is deficient a third time, the student\nis dropped from the university.\n \nStudents who have been authorized to carry fewer than 12 credit hours because of illness or outside employment\nmay be placed on academic probation if their work is deemed unsatisfactory by the Administrative Committee; they\nare removed from probation when the committee deems their work satisfactory. If they are not removed from\nprobation after a reasonable period of time, such students are dropped.\n \nThe internal record of a student dropped from the university under these regulations shows the notation \u201cDropped\nfor scholastic deficiency.\u201d\nAcademic Probation and Dismissal (Blair, PBDY)\nBlair: Students are placed on probation if they fail to meet class standing benchmarks, as noted above. Students on\nprobation must qualify for class standing in one additional semester or risk being dropped from the university.\n \nStudents are placed on academic probation: if they fail to meet class standing benchmarks; if they complete fewer\nthan 12 hours in a fall or spring semester except in cases involving documented mitigating circumstances (illness,\ninjury, or family emergency); or if their semester grade point averages fall below 1.8 overall or 2.0 in music. In\naddition, first-year students are placed on academic probation if they do not complete one writing course.\n \nIncomplete grades may adversely affect class standing or grade point averages.\n \nStudents on academic probation may not transfer summer study credit, elect to take courses on a Pass/Fail basis,\nearn credit by departmental examination, or participate in any extracurricular performance activity. They are\nrequired to participate in a special academic advising program. Students will be placed on probation no more than\ntwice. Students who are candidates for probation a third time will be dropped from the university.\n \nPeabody: After achieving sophomore standing, the student may not be on academic probation for more than two\nPage 89 of 1019\nsemesters. A student whose academic record warrants a third semester of probation normally will be dropped from\nthe university. Students will be placed on academic probation if any of the following conditions apply:\n \nFreshmen\n1. The student\u2019s cumulative grade point average falls below 1.800. Probation is removed (assuming there is no\nother reason for the probation) when the student\u2019s grade point average is raised to 1.800 or above.\n2. The student fails to earn at least 12 hours in a regular semester as a freshman. Probation is removed when\nthe student earns at least 12 hours in a subsequent semester and/or is judged to be making satisfactory\nacademic progress.\n3. The student fails to achieve sophomore standing in the required two semesters. Probation is removed when\nthe student achieves sophomore standing.\n4. Freshmen who pass fewer than two regular courses in their first regular semester or who earn a grade point\naverage lower than 1.000 have so seriously compromised their academic standing that they may be required\nto take an academic probationary leave of absence during the spring semester.\nSophomores \n1. The student\u2019s cumulative grade point average falls below 1.800. Probation is removed (assuming there is no\nother reason for the probation) when the student\u2019s grade point average is raised to 1.800 or above, except\nthat at the end of the second regular semester the student must qualify for junior standing. \n2. The student fails to earn at least 12 hours in a regular semester as a sophomore. Probation is removed when\nthe student earns at least 12 hours in a subsequent semester and/or is judged to be making satisfactory\nacademic progress.\n3. The student is placed on probation by the Undergraduate Administrative Committee for failure to make\nsatisfactory progress toward the degree. Probation is removed when the specified conditions are met.\n4. The student fails to achieve junior standing in the required two semesters after achieving sophomore\nstanding. Probation is removed when junior standing is achieved.\nJuniors \n1. The student\u2019s cumulative grade point average falls below 1.900. Probation is removed (assuming there is no\nother reason for the probation) when the grade point average is raised to 900 or above, except that at the\nend of the second regular semester the student must qualify for senior standing.\n2. The student fails to earn at least 12 hours in a regular semester as a junior. Probation is removed when the\nstudent earns at least 12 hours in a subsequent semester and/or is judged to be making satisfactory\nacademic progress.\n3. The student is placed on probation by the Undergraduate Administrative Committee for failure to make\nsatisfactory progress toward the degree. Probation is removed when the specified conditions are met.\n4. The student fails to achieve senior standing in the required two semesters after achieving junior standing.\nProbation is removed when senior standing is achieved.\nSeniors\n1. The student\u2019s cumulative grade point average falls below 2.000. Probation is removed when the grade point\naverage is raised to 2.000 or above. \n2. The student fails to earn at least 12 hours in a regular semester as a senior, unless the semester is one in\nwhich the student needs fewer than 12 hours in order to complete the requirements for graduation (see\nsection on Course Load, above). Probation is removed when the student earns at least 12 hours in a\nsubsequent semester and/or is judged to be making satisfactory academic progress and/or completes the\nrequirements for graduation.\nPetitions and Appeals (A&S, PBDY)\nArts & Science: The Administrative Committee of the College of Arts and Science entertains petitions from\ncurrently enrolled students for exceptions to academic regulations. Any student subject to action by the\nAdministrative Committee may appeal that action to the committee in writing. Further appeals from decisions of the\ncommittee follow standard university policies as described in the Student Handbook.\n \nPeabody: The procedures of the appeal process pertaining to academic matters within Peabody College are listed\nbelow. Please see the chapter \u201cStudent Accountability\u201d in the Vanderbilt University Student Handbook for a\ndescription of the appeal process for non-academic matters.\nPage 90 of 1019\nPetitions for exceptions to academic policies, appeals of academic policy implementations by Peabody Dean\u2019s Office\nstaff, and appeals of academic actions by the Undergraduate Administrative Committee (UAC) Chair (e.g., letters of\ndismissal) may be directed to the full UAC.\n \nPetitions and appeals should be sent to the Peabody Office of Academic Services\n- peabodyacademicservices@vanderbilt.edu, Peabody Administration Building.\n \nA student may ask the UAC to reconsider a decision if the student has new information to offer. The chair of the UAC\nwill decide whether the full UAC will reconsider. Requests for reconsideration of UAC decisions should be sent to the\nabove address.\n \nA final, negative decision of the UAC may be appealed to the dean of Peabody College (at the above address), who\nmay assign an associate dean to handle the matter on the dean\u2019s behalf. The dean or associate dean will consult\nwith the UAC and other relevant faculty or staff as part of the review of the decision.\n \nFurther appeals beyond Peabody College should be directed to the Provost\u2019s Office.\nEnrollment Status & Changes\nTransfer Students (Blair)\nAlternate Track (PBDY)\nLeave of Absence (A&S, Blair, VUSE, PBDY)\nReturning to the College (A&S)\nWithdrawal from the University (A&S, VUSE, PBDY)\nChange of Address (A&S, Blair, VUSE)\n \nTransfer Students (Blair)\nBlair: Transfer applicants must comply with university standards (see the chapter on Admissions). The required\naudition is of major importance in the evaluation of any application. Composition applicants must submit a\ncomposition portfolio and interview with a member of the composition faculty.\n \nTransfer students must submit catalog copy and course syllabi from the previous institution(s). A level of\nperformance study is assigned based on the entrance audition. Credit for courses is subject to evaluation. Music\ncourses may require an examination to verify placement and/or credit at Vanderbilt, and credit for non-music\ncourses must be approved through the YES Transfer Credit portal. Transfer students must complete at least half the\ncredit required for the degree, or 63 hours, at the Blair School. See also, Transfer courses.\n \nIntra-university transfer. Students intending to transfer within the university should meet with the head of academic\nadvising and file appropriate paperwork. For students transferring out of the B.Mus. or B.Mus.Arts program, music\nfees are covered through the end of the final term as a B.Mus. or B.Mus.Arts student. All students are expected to\nmaintain a minimum of 3 credit hours within their home school until transfer is approved. First-year students are\nineligible for transfer status until the end of their second semester. Students who transferred to Vanderbilt\nUniversity from another institution are eligible for intra-university transfer after having completed one semester in\nresidence and having achieved sophomore standing. See also, the chapter on Admissions.\nPage 91 of 1019\nAlternate Track (PBDY)\nPeabody: Occasionally students find that it will be necessary to reduce their normal load due to medical reasons,\nvarsity athletics, or other circumstances. The result is that they will accomplish the bachelor of science degree in\nnine or ten semesters instead of eight. In such cases, the student may request Alternate Track status. After\ndiscussing this option with their parents and faculty adviser, students petition the Associate Dean for Undergraduate\nAcademic Affairs for permission. This normally takes place during the sophomore year. Additional information is\navailable by contacting the Associate Dean for Undergraduate Academic Affairs.\nLeave of Absence (A&S, Blair, VUSE, PBDY)\nArts & Science: A student desiring a leave of absence should obtain instructions from the Dean\u2019s Office of\nUndergraduate Education in the College of Arts and Science. All students who have completed one regular\n(fall/spring) semester at Vanderbilt are eligible, provided they have not been dropped by the university and are not\ndropped at the end of the semester during which application is made. Students may take a leave no more than twice\nduring their career in the College of Arts and Science.\n \nLeaves are granted for one semester or for a year. Applications should be completed before the end of the fall\nsemester for a leave of absence during the spring semester, and before August 15 for a leave of absence during the\nfall semester (or for the academic year). If the leave is approved, the student must keep the Office of the University\nRegistrar informed of any change of address while on leave.\n \nA student who takes a medical leave after mid-semester is expected to be on leave for the following regular\nsemester as well. A student who plans to return from medical leave must submit appropriate documentation to the\nDean\u2019s Office of Undergraduate Education and the Office of Student Care Coordination.\n \nA student in good standing who seeks to transfer to Vanderbilt credit earned elsewhere while on leave of absence\nmust obtain permission in advance from the Office of Undergraduate Education. Requests for leave of absence for\npurpose of semester study away may be allowed if the semester study-away institution is domestic to the student.\nRequests for leave of absence plus semester study away are not allowed if the semester study-away institution is\ninternational to the student.\n \nRegistration information is emailed to students on leave of absence. A student failing to register at the conclusion of\nthe stated leave will be withdrawn from the university and must apply for reinstatement.\n \nBlair: A student in good standing may, with the approval of the associate dean, take leave of absence for one or two\nsemesters. Application forms, available from the Blair Office of Academic Services, must be submitted by 1\nDecember for spring semester leave or by 1 May for fall semester.\n \nStudents planning to study elsewhere while on leave (elective courses) must have prior approval if credits are to be\ntransferable. Upon the student\u2019s return, a performance examination during the first two weeks of the semester may\nbe needed to determine the student\u2019s standing in the major performance area.\n \nRegistration notifications are emailed to students on leave. A student failing to register at the conclusion of the\nstated leave will be withdrawn from the university and must apply for readmission.\n \nStudents who have been on leave of absence and not enrolled for three or more semesters or who leave the\nuniversity while on academic probation must re-audition and achieve the approval of the associate dean prior to\nreadmission.\n \nPage 92 of 1019\nEngineering: A student at Vanderbilt or one who has been admitted to Vanderbilt may, with the approval of his or\nher academic dean, take an official leave of absence for as much as two semesters and a summer session. Leave of\nabsence forms are available in the Office of Academic Services. A student who fails to register in the university at\nthe end of the leave will be withdrawn from the university.\n \nPeabody: A student desiring a leave of absence should obtain the appropriate forms from the Peabody Office of\nAcademic Services website: peabody.vanderbilt.edu/admin-offices/oas/downloads.php. All students are eligible,\nprovided they have not been dropped by the university and are not dropped at the end of the semester during which\napplication is made.\n \nLeaves are granted for one or two semesters. Applications should be completed before the end of the fall semester\nfor a leave of absence during the spring semester and before 15 August for a leave of absence during the fall\nsemester (or for the academic year). If the leave is approved, the student must keep the Dean\u2019s Office informed of\nany change of address while on leave.\n \nShould a student seek to transfer to Vanderbilt credit earned elsewhere while on a leave of absence, it is mandatory\nthat permission be obtained in advance from the Dean\u2019s Office. Petitions for leaves of this type must be filed at\nleast one month before the close of the preceding semester.\n \nWhile the student is on leave, registration information will be emailed to his or her Vanderbilt email address. A\nstudent failing to register at the conclusion of the stated leave will be withdrawn from the university and must apply\nfor readmission.\n \nStudents who wish to participate in a non-Vanderbilt program in the United States, abroad, or at sea should apply\nfor a leave of absence for the relevant semester. To qualify for such a leave, a student must be in good standing at\nVanderbilt with at least a 2.700 grade point average as of the date of application. Students must obtain prior\napproval for the leave of absence and for the credits to be taken in other programs if the credits are to be\ntransferred to Vanderbilt. Final approval of leaves of absence always rests with the Dean\u2019s Office. See the section on\nTransfer Credit in this chapter.\nReturning to the College (A&S)\nArts & Science: Students on leave of absence return to the university at the end of the leave. If they do not return\nat that time and want to return later, they must apply to the Office of the University Registrar for reinstatement.\nStudents who are advised to withdraw from the university determine whether or not to return in consultation with\nthe Dean\u2019s Office of Undergraduate Education. Students who have been dropped may apply to the Office of the\nUniversity Registrar for reinstatement; in most cases reinstatement is not granted unless there has been an\nintervening period of at least a year. The Office of the University Registrar forwards all documents to the\nAdministrative Committee, which considers each case on an individual basis. Reinstatement is competitive, and\nthere is no assurance that it will be granted.\n \nStudents reinstated after having been advised to withdraw or after having been dropped are automatically on final\nprobation. If they fail to regain good standing and to maintain it until graduation, they are dropped again with little\nprospect for reinstatement. Application deadlines for reinstatement are as follows: July 15 for the fall semester,\nNovember 15 for the spring semester, and April 1 for the summer session.\nWithdrawal from the University (A&S, VUSE, PBDY)\nArts & Sciences: Students proposing to withdraw from the university during a regular term must report to the\nDean\u2019s Office of Undergraduate Education in the College of Arts and Science to initiate proper clearance procedures.\nIf withdrawal from the university is officially authorized, the student will receive withdrawal grades on the same\nbasis as a student withdrawing from a particular course or courses. (See the section on Period for Withdrawal under\nRegistration above).\nPage 93 of 1019\nEngineering: A student proposing to withdraw from the university must notify the Office of Academic Services of\nthe School of Engineering so that proper clearance may be granted and incomplete work is not charged as a failure\nagainst the student\u2019s record.\n \nPeabody: Students proposing to withdraw from the university during any semester must report to the Associate\nDean for Undergraduate Academic Affairs  to initiate proper clearance procedures. Students are graded on the same\nbasis as if withdrawing from a course. Students who withdraw before the end of the eighth week of classes receive a\npartial refund of tuition (see the section on Financial Information).\nChange of Address (A&S, Blair, VUSE)\nArts & Science: Students are responsible for keeping the university informed of their correct mailing addresses,\nboth school and home. They should notify the university, through the Office of the University Registrar, online or in\nwriting, of any address changes as soon as possible. They are provided an opportunity to review address information\nat registration. The university will consider notices and other information delivered if mailed to the address on file in\nthe Office of the University Registrar.\n \nBlair: Any change of address should be submitted to the Office of the University Registrar at yes.vanderbilt.edu.\nThe university will consider notices or other information delivered if mailed to the address currently on file.\n \nEngineering: Any change of address should be reported to the Office of the University Registrar using the YES\nonline form. The university will consider notices or other information delivered if mailed to the address on file in YES.\nSpecial Programs\nImmersion Vanderbilt (Blair, VUSE)\nBlair: To fulfill the university requirement of Immersion Vanderbilt, a student must participate in an intensive\nlearning experience that takes place in and beyond the classroom and culminates in the creation of a tangible final\nproject. This requirement applies to all students who entered Vanderbilt as first-year students in or after summer\n2018, as second-year students in or after summer 2019, or as third-year students in or after summer 2020.\n \nImmersion Vanderbilt is divided into four broad pathways: civic and professional, creative expression, international,\nand research. The pathway selected by the student may focus on one or more than one of these areas and should\nprovide a structure upon which students can brainstorm, plan, and execute their immersive projects across multiple\nyears.\n \nMost Blair students will take advantage of the senior recital experience or honors thesis in\nethnomusicology/musicology to satisfy the requirements of Immersion Vanderbilt. However, students may choose to\npursue an Immersion plan outside their home program. Students should consult the Office of Experiential Learning\nand Immersion Vanderbilt. Completion of the Immersion Vanderbilt graduation requirement will be shown on the\nstudent's degree audit, and the title of the Immersion project will be added to the student's\ntranscript. vanderbilt.edu/immersion\n \nEngineering: Immersion Vanderbilt (vanderbilt.edu/immersion) allows students to pursue a multi-year path to be\ncurious, to develop their passions and to learn by experience. To fulfill the university requirement of Immersion\nVanderbilt, a student must participate in immersive experiences and then complete a culminating project that is\nbased on one specific immersive experience.\n \nThe experiential learning may focus on one or more areas of student interest.  Most engineering students will take\nPage 94 of 1019\nadvantage of a four-year engineering design experience to satisfy the requirements of Immersion Vanderbilt. Each\nengineering major offers such a multi-year experience within its curriculum. Students whose plans include\nprofessional development may also pursue industrial internships. A research path can engage the student in\ndiscovery through research in engineering or other fields. While most engineering students will select an immersion\nexperience associated with their major, students can pursue an Immersion plan outside their home program. For\nexample, students interested in creative expression might develop a performance piece, exhibit, or artistic work,\nwhile those interested in international study may explore firsthand the culture, language, and history of other\ncountries. Students interested in such immersion plans should consult the Office of Experiential Learning and\nImmersion Vanderbilt.\n \nThe Immersion Vanderbilt process is composed of several phases. The initial step involves the creation of a plan that\nidentifies the intended Immersive experience. Before students start their immersive experience, they will submit the\nImmersive Experience Declaration Form. Students may submit multiple immersive experience forms throughout\ntheir time at Vanderbilt University. After each experience, a self-reflection component is required.\n \nImmersion Vanderbilt culminates in the creation of a final project arising from one of the experiences. Approval and\nassessment of the project is done by the supervising school or college. Senior design projects in the School of\nEngineering satisfy the final project requirement for Immersion Vanderbilt, with students presenting the results of\ntheir design project at the school\u2019s Design Day. For students completing other immersion projects, Immersion\ncoordinates a series of showcases open to the entire campus where students display their projects. Upon completion\nof the project, Immersion Vanderbilt conveys that the requirements have been met by showing completion of the\nImmersion Vanderbilt graduation requirement on the student\u2019s degree audit and adding the Immersion project to\nthe student\u2019s transcript.\nStudy Abroad (Blair)\nBlair: Five Vanderbilt study abroad programs are coordinated with the degree programs in music: the IES programs\nin Milan, Italy; Vienna, Austria; and in Amsterdam, The Netherlands; the DIS program at the Royal Danish Academy\nof Music in Copenhagen, Denmark, and the IFSA/Butler program at the University of Sydney and Sydney\nConservatorium of Music in Sydney, Australia. These programs include provisions for lesson and ensemble credits,\ncontingent upon audition and admission to the program. These will count towards the Blair music core and are\ncovered at least in part by regular tuition and fees, although students are responsible for any instrument rental fees\nthey accrue. All programs also allow for a range of liberal arts and elective credits. Further information can be\nobtained from the Vanderbilt Global Education Office, Suite 103, Student Life Center, or vanderbilt.edu/geo, and\nfrom Blair\u2019s associate dean.\n \nBlair students may also elect any of the Vanderbilt-approved study abroad programs; see descriptions under \u201cStudy\nAbroad\u201d in the front chapters of the catalog. Blair students in these programs have typically enrolled in music\nelectives, courses in the liberal arts core, and course work toward minors and second majors. Students in these\nprograms typically arrange alternative performance or composition instruction, and those fees are usually not\ncovered by tuition. It should be noted that if a program has been approved by Vanderbilt students must enroll in the\nprogram via the Global Education Office. In no case, after matriculating at Vanderbilt, may a student apply to\nparticipate in a program for transfer credit through a different university, or through an external agency, and then\nseek to transfer that credit into Vanderbilt. Any student studying abroad must register with Vanderbilt's global travel\noffice.\nBlair-Specific Provisions\nInternships (Blair)\nBlair: The Career Center assists students interested in internship opportunities in the music industry and elsewhere;\nthere are opportunities in many states of the U.S. and also abroad, both during the academic year and in the\nsummer. A student serving as an intern may register for MENT 3880, 3881, or 3882 as a corollary if credit is desired.\nStudents with summer internships that require an academic component must register for credit\n(vanderbilt.edu/career/career-exploration/internships/summer-internship-subsidy/). A maximum of 6 hours of\ninternship credit may be counted toward the degree. Students are responsible for finding a faculty sponsor; a\nwritten study plan must be approved by the faculty sponsor and the Blair associate dean no later than the tenth day\nof classes. Internship paperwork is available on the Blair School website at blair.vanderbilt.edu/academics.\nPage 95 of 1019\nPerformance Instruction: B. Mus. and B. Mus. Arts Degrees (Blair)\nBlair: Fees. Performance instruction fees are waived for B.Mus. and B.Mus.Arts students. A one-time music\ntechnology fee is charged to each first-year student.\n \nElective credit. B.Mus. and B.Mus.Arts students taking a second instrument normally enroll in 1100-level\nperformance instruction for 1 or 2 hours elective credit. Consent of the instructor is required. B.Mus. and B.Mus.Arts\nstudents who have declared a minor instrument also register for performance instruction at the 1100 level; consent\nof the instructor and notification of the Blair Office of Academic Services are required.\n \nComposition Majors. Students register for performance instruction at the 1100 level. A minimum of 6 semesters of\nstudy totaling 6 credit hours is required.\n \nIntegrated Studies Majors, Integrated Studies/Teacher Education Majors, Jazz Studies Majors, and B.Mus.Arts\nstudents. First-year students and sophomores register for 2100-level performance instruction in their primary area.\nJuniors and seniors register for 4100-level performance instruction in their primary area. A minimum of 8 semesters\ntotaling 16 credit hours required; performance instruction required every semester in residence.\n \nPerformance Majors. First-year students and sophomores register for 2200-level performance instruction in their\nprimary area. Juniors and seniors register for 4200-level instruction in their primary area. A minimum of 8 semesters\ntotaling 32 hours (instrumental performance majors) or 28 hours (vocal performance majors) required; performance\ninstruction required every semester in residence.\nUpper Divisional Hearing (Blair)\nBlair: Requirements for performance majors include an upper divisional hearing in the sophomore year to\ndetermine continuance in the performance degree program and permit subsequent enrollment in upper division\nstudy at the 4200 level. Students are required to perform a program of twenty to thirty minutes for a faculty\ncommittee convened by the studio instructor or by the department chair. The committee will normally consist of the\nstudent\u2019s studio teacher and at least two additional members of the department. Memorization is required as\nappropriate, and where called for, collaboration with piano is expected.\n \nThe student must consult with the studio instructor regarding appropriate repertoire. Instrumental selections must\nbe chosen from the solo repertoire and should represent diverse historical periods. Percussionists must perform on\nkeyboard percussion, timpani, and snare drum and/or multiple percussion. String repertoire must include solo Bach.\nPianists must perform a 30-minute memorized program of solo piano literature representing at least three style\nperiods. Vocal repertoire must include a minimum of five songs of contrasting periods and styles, using three\nlanguages (Italian, English, and either French or German).\n \nFailure to pass this hearing demonstrates a lack of the requisite skills to graduate in performance at the Blair School,\nnecessitating transfer to another degree program. A student may petition the faculty once for a second hearing,\nwith entirely different repertoire, to take place before the end of the first semester of the junior year\nPre-Recital Hearing (Blair)\nBlair: All students (excepting composition) giving required recitals and any student who wishes to give a recital in\nthe Blair building must pass a hearing, held at least three weeks before the recital. After establishing a recital date,\nthe student, with guidance from the studio instructor, will assemble a recital hearing committee, consisting of two\nadditional faculty members, one of whom must be from outside the student\u2019s performing area. For integrated\nstudies/teacher education students, the committee will normally consist of the studio instructor, a teacher education\nfaculty member, and at least one additional faculty member. For non-required, non-credit recitals, the hearing\ncommittee may be from within the department. For any recital involving a student\u2019s second performing medium, the\nstudent must seek approval from the studio instructor and area coordinator of the secondary and primary\nperforming areas; in addition, a full-time faculty member from the secondary performing area must be part of the\nPage 96 of 1019\nhearing committee. The student must notify the recital hearing committee, in writing, of the hearing date, recital\ndate, time, and place. Senior composition recitals are screened in advance at the department level.\n \nFor a required junior or senior recital, the repertoire will normally encompass three major style periods, as\nappropriate to the medium; at least one work in a contemporary idiom will be included in either the junior or senior\nrecital. For teacher education students, a conducting component must be included on the required senior recital. For\njazz studies students, an original composition or arrangement must be included on the required senior recital. A\nrequired senior recital must also include written or spoken program notes, visual media, or other audience\nengagement component, with the approval of the studio instructor. The hearing committee should hear all of the\nrecital repertoire. Grading of the hearing is on a Pass/Fail basis, with written faculty comments. If a student fails the\nhearing, another must be scheduled. Only two recital hearings in one semester are permitted.\n \nFor students also choosing the senior recital to fulfill Immersion Vanderbilt, the recital program and audience\nengagement component should be a deeper, more intensive project that integrates classroom knowledge with\nexperience. The student will work with the project\u2019s primary Immersion adviser (usually the studio teacher) to\ndevelop a plan relevant to the student\u2019s recital. While there are no specific requirements, examples may be found in\nthe Blair Student Handbook. The student\u2019s Immersion adviser will ultimately decide if the plan fulfills the Immersion\nVanderbilt project.\nRecital and Recital Committee (Blair)\nBlair: For recitals given for credit, the recital committee is the same as the hearing committee whenever possible.\nThe final grade is a composite of those of at least two committee members, including the studio instructor, with the\nstudio instructor\u2019s grade valued at two thirds of the total. Copies of committee member\u2019s grades are kept by the\ninstructor. Recitals not given for credit are not graded; they involve a hearing committee but not a recital\ncommittee.\nRecital Attendance (Blair)\nBlair: Each semester in residence, students (except graduating seniors in their penultimate or final semester) are\nrequired to register for MUSO 1000 and attend weekly student recitals/convocations and a minimum of six Blair\nfaculty or professional concerts or their community equivalents as described on the syllabus. Students must fulfill\nboth aspects of the requirement to pass each semester. The course receives zero credit hours but is graded on a\nPass/Fail basis and listed on students\u2019 transcripts. A temporary final grade will not be granted except in the case of\ndocumented medical emergency.\n \nStudents must register their attendance at each recital. Two absences from Friday afternoon recitals are permitted\neach semester. Under extraordinary circumstances, make-up assignments can be obtained from the recital\nattendance coordinator with the permission of the associate dean. Students must plan and keep up with their\nconcert attendance. Except for weekly student recitals, performances in which students are participants do not fulfill\nthe attendance requirement for the performer. Deadline for completion of all work is listed on the course syllabus for\nMUSO 1000. The first failure would result in the loss of the senior penultimate or final semester exemption.\nAdditional failure(s) would require students to enroll for additional semester(s) until the seven required semesters\nare passed.\nExtracurricular Performance (Blair)\nBlair: Students must be in good standing and have the consent of their private instructors in order to participate in\nany extracurricular performance activities, including in-school collaboration, that are not required by a student\u2019s\ndegree program or honor scholarship.\nCollege of Arts and Science\nCollege of Arts and Science Administration and Faculty\nTimothy P.

It is the basis of all professional study. No professional\nschool can be self-sufficient. The College in its undergraduate and graduate work must remain the heart of the whole\nsituation, and send its quickening life blood into every fiber and tissue.\u201d\n\u2014Chancellor James H. Kirkland at the semicentennial celebration of the university October 1925\n \nChancellor Kirkland\u2019s words were prophetic of our times as well as true of his own. Since its founding Vanderbilt has\npursued its mission of excellence in the liberal arts with a commitment to liberal learning that is the special concern\nof the College of Arts and Science. Liberal learning endures because it brings men and women to subjects, concepts,\nand modes of thought that enable them to think critically about where humanity has been and where it ought to be\ngoing. The liberal arts spark curiosity and broaden vision, help to instill understanding of matters otherwise\nunknown, and encourage individuals to live their lives with a sense of purpose, context, and relatedness. A liberal\neducation has perennial relevance and usefulness: it should prepare its recipients to think precisely, to reason\nclearly, and to judge wisely\u2014all practical considerations in the pursuit of constructive and satisfying lives and in the\npractice of today\u2019s professions and vocations.\n \nToday the College of Arts and Science maintains its historic position as the heart of the university. Excellence in\nundergraduate and graduate education is its unwavering aim.\n \nThe College of Arts and Science provides intellectual stimulation, training, and incentive designed to foster the\nlifelong liberal learning of its graduates. It offers challenging, forward-looking programs of study in the humanities,\nnatural sciences, and social sciences resourcefully taught by distinguished faculty recognized for excellence in\nresearch, scholarship, and creative expression. It promotes self-realization and expression in the context of social\nresponsibility.\n \nFaculty and Students\nThe College of Arts and Science derives its strength from the range of its academic offerings, from the quality of the\nfaculty who teach, and from the quality of the students who come to learn. Traditionally fortunate in its ability to\nattract and retain a superior faculty, the College of Arts and Science has more than 500 full-time professors who\nsupplement their achievements in the classroom with significant research, creativity, and writing. Many faculty\nmembers hold awards for distinguished scholarship and have been elected to high offices in their professional\nassociations, including the Classical Association of the Middle West and South, the American Economics Association,\nthe American Political Science Association, the American Philosophical Association, the American Physical Society,\nPage 99 of 1019\nthe American Historical Association, and the Biophysical Society.\n \nThe quality of the College\u2019s faculty is matched by that of its diverse student body. Undergraduates come from the\nfifty states and fifteen to twenty foreign countries and are almost evenly divided between men and women.\n \nAcademic Support\nThe Writing Studio / Tutoring Services\nThe Writing Studio provides undergraduate students the opportunity to meet with trained writing consultants to\ndiscuss individual writing concerns, from invention to drafting to revision. The Writing Studio provides a space for\nstudents to discuss work-in-progress with expert writers, to create their own writing, and to utilize available\nresources for improving both writing and critical thinking skills.\n \nThe mission of the Vanderbilt Writing Studio is to enhance student writing and writing instruction, and to encourage\nregular conversation about the writing process. The Writing Studio\u2019s extensive programming includes individual\nconsultations, creative writing groups, workshops focused on specific issues in academic writing, open- mike\nreadings, and student-run writers\u2019 support groups.\n \nThe Writing Studio is located at 1801 Edgehill Avenue, Suite 112, and there is a satellite location in 217 Commons\nCenter convenient to the first-year residence halls. The Writing Studio website can be accessed at\n \nOne-on-one tutoring in many subjects is available through Tutoring Services, also located at 1801 Edgehill Avenue.\nConsultations in the Writing Studio and in Tutoring Services are free to all undergraduates.\n \nComputers\nThe following locations are available for walk-in use of computers and software:\n \nCenter for Second Language Studies (Furman Hall 001)\nStevenson computer lab and lounge (Stevenson Center 2200)\nWilson computer lab (Wilson Hall 120)\n \nAll of the college\u2019s computer labs and classrooms offer a wide variety of \u201ccourseware\u201d and commercial \u201cproductivity\nsoftware,\u201d including word processing packages. Color printing and scanners are available in most of the labs. In\naddition to accessing software on the local servers, students may also connect to both campus services and the\ninternet, including VUGmail and e-resources in the libraries, as well as course materials in Brightspace. While use of\nthe above facilities is free, printing is charged per page.\n \nThe computer classrooms in the Center for Second Language Studies and Wilson Hall are available for walk-in use\nduring the late afternoon and evening hours. Stevenson Center lab and lounge are card-accessible weeknights until\n1:00\na.m. All lab hours are posted by semester at In addition to the college facilities, a few \u201ckiosk\u201d systems are available\nin the Sarratt Student Center. As a result, access to computers in the College of Arts and Science is extensive.\n \nPage 100 of 1019\nAt last count, more than 98 percent of Vanderbilt students own a personal computer. Since all students also have a\nhigh-speed network connection, it is convenient for students to have their own system (please consult the ResNet\nguidelines for supported systems). However, most students will find that the college computing facilities provide all\nof the computing resources that are needed for success at Vanderbilt.\n \nThe Advising System\nEntering first-year students are assigned advisers from CASPAR (College of Arts and Science Pre-major Academic\nAdvising Resources Center). These \u201cpre-major advisers\u201d counsel students during their first three and one-half\nsemesters, or until the students choose majors, when they are assigned faculty advisers in their major department\nor program. Pre-major advisers are specially trained to help students move efficiently through the requirements of\nAXLE (Achieving eXcellence in Liberal Education) and chart a course of study.\n \nDuring the last two years of study, when a student is acquiring depth of knowledge in a major field, studies are\nguided by a specialist in that field. Students are encouraged to see their faculty advisers at any time, since the\nadvisers are available for guidance and counseling and are faculty members with whom advisees may be studying.\n \nAll students are required to see their advisers prior to registration for each semester.\n \nAdvisers are generally happy to talk over any problems students may have, although their chief function is  \nacademic counseling. In addition, several members of the Dean\u2019s Office of Undergraduate Education, themselves\nteaching faculty members, have as their principal duty counseling students and referring them to sources of\nexpertise on non-academic problems.\n \nPublic Lectures\nTHE BERRY LECTURES. Established in 1988 through the generosity of Kendall and Allen Berry, John and Shirley\nLachs, Steve Turner, and Jim Burke. Three annual lectures\u2014the Berry lecture, the Steve Turner lecture, and the Jim\nBurke lecture\u2014are given by distinguished philosophers.\n \nTHE LOUIS JACOB BIRCHER LECTURE IN CHEMISTRY.

A distinguished astronomer is invited to present this lecture every third year.\n \nTHE SHANKS LECTURES. Established in 1984 and named for E. Baylis Shanks and Olivia H. Shanks in honor of their\naccomplishments in the fields of mathematics and education and in recognition of their loyalty and service to\nVanderbilt University, these lectures are presented on two successive days in the fall of each year. A special\ncommittee from the Department of Mathematics, influenced by the professional interests of Professor and Mrs.\nShanks, chooses the lecturers from mathematicians of the highest reputation. The topics of the lectureship vary\nfrom year to year according to the area of specialization of the speaker chosen. The lectures have been endowed by\nmembers of the family of Olivia and Baylis Shanks.\n \nTHE FRANCIS G. SLACK LECTURES IN PHYSICS. Established in 1977 by the Department of Physics and Astronomy in\nhonor of Francis G. Slack, former Landon C.

Recent participants have included Dannie\nAbse, Madison Smartt Bell, Ellen Gilchrist, Alison Lurie, Czeslaw Milosz, Wyatt Prunty, Ann Thwaite, Anthony\nThwaite, and Helen Vendler.\nDegree Programs in the College\nThe Bachelor of Arts\nPage 102 of 1019\nLimitation on Credit Hours Outside the College\nAXLE: Achieving eXcellence in Liberal Education\nWhat Is Liberal Education?\nFear No Learning!\nHow to Get Started\nWhere to Get Information\nWhere to Get Advice\nWhat is AXLE?\nOverview of AXLE\nThe First-Year Writing Seminar\nThe Writing Requirement\nThe Liberal Arts Requirement\nThe Major\nAXLE Curriculum Course Distribution\nAXLE, the Major, and the Optional Minor\nAdvanced Placement under AXLE\nTransfer Credit under AXLE\nArea of Concentration\nMajor Field\nDefined Interdisciplinary Programs\nDeclaration of the Area of Concentration\nIndividually Designed Interdisciplinary Majors\nDouble and Triple Majors\nApproved Second Majors Outside the College\nThe Bachelor of Arts\nThe bachelor of arts degree is granted upon successful completion of the following five requirements:\n1. At least 120 semester hours of creditable college work,\n2. A final grade point average of at least 2.000,\n3. Completion of the AXLE requirements,\n4. Completion of one of the options listed under Area of Concentration,\n5. Completion of at least 102 credit hours of course work within the College of Arts and Science, or a minimum\nof 90 credit hours for those students with a second major outside the College of Arts and Science.\nLimitation on Credit Hours outside the College\nCandidates for the bachelor of arts degree must successfully complete a minimum of 102 credit hours within the\nCollege of Arts and Science. Students who are completing an approved second major from one of the other schools\nwithin Vanderbilt are required to complete 90 credit hours within the College of Arts and Science for the bachelor of\narts degree.\n \nPage 103 of 1019\nAXLE: Achieving eXcellence in Liberal Education\nThe Arts and Science core program of study\u2014known as AXLE\u2014is anchored in intensive practice in writing and a\ndiverse thirteen-course component of classes that has been designed to allow maximum choice in course selection\n(based on student interests and achievement levels). At the same time, the distribution requirements of AXLE\nensure that students will explore intellectually and academically the breadth of possibilities represented by the\nliberal arts.\n \nWhat Is Liberal Education?\nThe study of the liberal arts\u2014what is historically called a liberal education\u2014is the oldest and most venerable form of\nhigher education. It has proved itself perennially flexible and adaptive over the past centuries, and it remains the\nsingle best educational preparation for further, specialized study in the professions (medicine, law, education,\nbusiness, et al.), as well as for doctoral work in the humanities and social sciences and advanced research in the\nsciences. The holistic focus of a liberal education encompasses all areas of human knowledge: the natural and social\nsciences, mathematics, foreign languages and cultures, the arts, and the humanities. The empirical disciplines guide\nus in our efforts to live most productively and efficiently. But the rest of the curriculum\u2014the humanities and the arts\n\u2014makes it possible to reflect upon the right use of the remarkable scientific knowledge we have acquired. In a\nliberal arts education, content is always considered in its larger context. Thus, the reflective and discursive aspects\nof study in the liberal arts call upon students to move beyond the mere acquisition of information to inquire into the\ndeeper issues within their studies, and to connect their learning across disciplines and cultures as they live and work\nin the communal environment of Vanderbilt. The end product of a successful liberal arts education is a thoughtful\ncitizen who is prepared to take up his or her rights and responsibilities in a democratic society, to analyze and\ncritique received information, to articulate the issues at hand or the personal values at stake, and whose intellectual\nlife is marked by ongoing internal dialogue about the quality and meaning of life for him or her, as well as for the\ncommunity at large.\n \nFear No Learning!\nThe interdisciplinary inclination of many courses in the College of Arts and Science is an ideal training ground for\nlearning new methodologies for problem solving in the complex, global world of the 21st century. Here, students\nmay work with biologists and psychologists in the Neuroscience program; study with creative writers, sociologists,\nhistorians, or cinema and media arts scholars in the African American and Diaspora Studies program; or take a class,\nteam taught, by professors from the School of Music and the Department of English in the College of Arts and\nScience. Over the course of a Vanderbilt education, students challenge themselves with the academic demands of\nthe classes  they select, and are challenged by new ideas and unfamiliar ways of looking at issues. Exploring beyond\nthe boundaries of one\u2019s intellectual comfort zone in order to admit new ideas is one of the most important aspects of\nhigher education. The time and effort devoted to selecting thoughtfully the courses that will satisfy AXLE\nrequirements prepare students for the more specialized study that they undertake in their major (or majors).\n \nHow to Get Started\nThe program of studies is divided approximately into thirds:\n \n1/3 \u2014 courses to meet the requirements of the Writing and Liberal Arts requirements;\n1/3 \u2014 courses required to complete the chosen major;\n1/3 \u2014 electives, which will complete the 120 credit hours required for graduation.\n \nThese divisions are approximate and may differ for individual students.\n \nFor a student\u2019s first semester, most selections should be from the first group, courses that will fulfill the Writing and\nPage 104 of 1019\nLiberal Arts requirements. Academic background, career goals, and general talents and interests will affect choice of\ncourses.\n \nUpon graduation, students in the College of Arts and Science will receive a bachelor of arts degree upon completion\nof the other four requirements in addition to AXLE: fulfillment of requirements for one major, a 2.000 average in the\nmajor, 120 cumulative earned credit hours, and a 2.000 average overall.\n \nWhere to Get Information\nIn addition to this catalog\u2019s sections on the rules, regulations, and policies of the College of Arts and Science as well\nas descriptions of the academic programs of all the undergraduate schools, students may refer to the booklet,\nUnderstanding Your Core Curriculum & Pre-major Advising, a College of Arts and Science manual for entering\nstudents.\n \nWhere to Get Advice\nEntering students are assigned pre-major advisers from CASPAR (College of Arts and Science Pre-major Academic\nAdvising Resources Center). Pre-major advisers are carefully selected and receive intensive training on how to help\nstudents proceed effectively through the requirements of AXLE and chart a course of study. These advisers will\ncounsel students through their first three and one-half semesters or until they declare a major. At that time,\nstudents are assigned faculty advisers in their major departments. Students are encouraged to see their advisers at\nany time; they must, however, consult their pre-major adviser three times during the first year: during summer\nbefore the fall semester, prior to the opening of enrollment windows for the spring semester, and prior to the\nopening of enrollment windows for the fall semester of their second year. Prior to their first semester, entering first-\nyear students must consult in June with their pre-major adviser who will assist with course selections for registration\nfor the fall and begin to understand each student\u2019s interests and goals. (This initial contact is typically via phone\nand/or email.)\n \nWhat Is AXLE?\nAXLE is the acronym for Achieving eXcellence in Liberal Education. It is the core curriculum that all students in the\nCollege of Arts and Science must fulfill. The AXLE curriculum is flexible and very user-friendly. It consists of two\nparts: the Writing Requirement and the Liberal Arts Requirement.\nThe Writing Requirement has four segments: completion of English 1100 or demonstration of basic skills in English\ncomposition; completion of a First-Year Writing Seminar; completion of a writing course (indicated by a \u201cW\u201d) no later\nthan the fourth semester in residence; and completion of a second writing course (indicated by a \u201cW\u201d) or an\napproved course in oral communication (CMST 2100, 2110, or 2120).\nThe Liberal Arts Requirement is composed of a total of thirteen courses taken at Vanderbilt, and distributed across\nsix categories. The First-Year Writing Seminar and all writing courses, and approved Oral Communication courses\nare also counted in the thirteen-course Liberal Arts Requirement.\n1. The Writing Requirement (three to four courses)\na. English Composition ENGL 1100 (appropriate test score or one course)\nb. First-Year Writing Seminar (one course)\nc. a W course before the end of the fourth semester (one course)\nd. a second W course or approved Oral Communication course (one course)\n2. The Liberal Arts Requirement (13 courses)\na. HCA \u2014 Humanities and the Creative Arts (three courses)\nb. INT \u2014 International Cultures (three courses)\nc. US \u2014 History and Culture of the United States (one course)\nd. MNS \u2014 Mathematics and Natural Sciences (three courses)\ne. SBS \u2014 Social and Behavioral Sciences (two courses)\nf. P \u2014 Perspectives (one course)\nAll students must also complete requirements for at least one major (between 27 and 48 credit hours of course\nPage 105 of 1019\nwork) and earn a minimum number of 120 earned credit hours in order to graduate.\n \nOverview of AXLE\nAXLE consists of two parts: the Writing Requirement (including a First-Year Writing Seminar) and the Liberal Arts\nRequirement.\n \nThe First-Year Writing Seminar\nThe First-Year Writing Seminar is an integral part of the first-year experience in the College of Arts and Science.\nThrough these seminars, first-year students engage in independent learning and inquiry in an environment in which\nthey can express knowledge and defend opinions through intensive class discussion, oral presentations, and written\nexpression. The small-group nature of these seminars allows for direct student-faculty interaction that stresses\ntraining in techniques of scholarly inquiry. The students\u2019 written work and oral presentations are subject to\nthoughtful critical review by the faculty member, providing feedback that can be used to reconsider the manner in\nwhich they articulate their ideas and to refine their skills in these areas. Thus, first-year students learn not only\nabout the subject matter of the seminar, but are also exposed to new methods of acquiring knowledge, different\nways of expressing and sharing ideas, and unique opportunities to participate in critical inquiry.\n \nAll first-year students must enroll in a First-Year Writing Seminar. (First-Year Writing Seminars in the College of Arts\nand Science are numbered 1111.) This course may be taken during the fall or the spring semester. Students are\npermitted to enroll in only one First-Year Writing Seminar per semester. All First-Year Writing Seminars also count in\ntheir appropriate distribution areas within the Liberal Arts Requirement, but a second seminar will not count toward\nthe writing requirement. Students who transfer into the College of Arts and Science (whether from another school at\nVanderbilt or from another college or university) do not complete a First-Year Writing Seminar. Students beyond\ntheir second semester in residence may not register for First-Year Writing Seminars, nor may First- Year Writing\nSeminars be repeated after completion of the second semester in residence.\n \nThe Writing Requirement\nExcellent communication skills, including the ability to articulate ideas and defend positions in writing, will be\nparamount for the 21st-century graduates of Vanderbilt University; therefore, all students in the College of Arts and\nScience must successfully complete the Writing Requirement.\na. All students must demonstrate competence in English composition. Appropriate skills in composition are\nessential to successful progress at the Competence is demonstrated by completion of ENGL 1100 or any of\nthe following test-based or transfer-credit satisfiers:\ni. SAT: Combined score of at least 1220 on the Writing and Critical Reasoning sections, with a minimum\nscore of 500 on each (test taken prior to March 2016).\nii. SAT: Score of at least 660 on the Evidence-Based Reading and Writing section.\niii. ACT: Score of at least 30 on the English portion (beginning October 2016).\niv. AP: Minimum score of 4 on the English Language or English Literature exam.\nv. IB: Minimum score of 6 on the Higher level English\nvi. Transfer credit for English 1100\nvii. Transfer credit for English 1210W, 1220W, 1230W, 1250W, 1260W, 1270W, or 1300W. (If used to\nsatisfy the English composition requirement, the transfer credit does NOT also count as the W course\nrequired to achieve junior standing.\nb. First-Year Writing Seminar (see above). \nc. All students must successfully complete at least one Arts and Science writing course (indicated by a \u201cW\u201d) at\nVanderbilt University, regardless of AP or IB credits, SAT scores, or ACT scores earned prior to matriculation.\nThe 1000-level writing-intensive courses emphasize general writing skills within the context of discipline-\nspecific subject matter. The 2000 and higher-level writing-intensive courses foster advanced, discipline-\nspecific writing skills. Departments or programs that offer these courses determine their specific writing In\n2000 or higher-level W courses, continued attention to the process of writing is included in the classroom.\nStudents receive regular feedback on their writing that will contribute toward enhancing writing skills\nappropriate to specific disciplines. The process of revising written work allows students to reflect on the\nwriting process; writing tutorials may also be included. All students are required to complete a W course\nPage 106 of 1019\n(other than ENGL 1100 or a First-Year Writing Seminar) no later than the fourth semester. All Arts and\nScience W courses also count in their appropriate distribution areas within the Liberal Arts Requirement.\nd. All students must successfully complete either a second Arts and Science W course (other than ENGL 1100 or\na First-Year Writing Seminar), or an approved course in oral communication (CMST 2100, 2110, 2120) at\nVanderbilt University, regardless of AP or IB credits, SAT scores, or ACT scores earned prior to Oral\ncommunication courses focus on developing improved public speaking skills. These courses introduce\nstudents to the principles and practices of public discourse and reasoned argument. Attention to the process\nof effective oral communication is integral to these classes. Students receive regular speaking assignments\nthroughout the semester and regular feedback to enhance effective speaking skills. All students must\ncomplete Part d of the Writing Requirement before graduation.\nThe Liberal Arts Requirement\nThe Liberal Arts Requirement consists of successful completion of thirteen courses from the College of Arts and\nScience. Most courses in the College of Arts and Science fulfill one of these Liberal Arts requirements. Courses must\ncarry three or more credits to count toward the AXLE Liberal Arts Requirement. Although some courses may be\nappropriate to more than one requirement, each course will fulfill only one requirement. These thirteen courses\nmust be distributed as outlined below. They must be taken from at least seven departments or subject areas.\n \na. Humanities and the Creative Arts \u2014 HCA (3 courses)\nCourses in the humanities and the creative arts challenge students to examine their personal understanding of life\nand how their individual experiences overlap with those of the rest of humankind. These courses testify to the\nvarying ways in which people think, form values, confront ambiguity, express spiritual and aesthetic yearnings, and\ngrapple with moral and ethical problems. By analyzing and interpreting literary, philosophical, religious, or artistic\nworks, students examine the foundations of human experience. By producing original artistic works in imaginative\nwriting, studio art, theatre, film, music, and dance, students have the opportunity to connect the universal sources\nof human inspiration with their own creative processes.\n \nb. International Cultures \u2014 INT (3 courses)\nThe study of international cultures provides students with a basis for understanding the diversity of experiences and\nvalues in our contemporary, global society. Options in this category include not only international history and\ncultural studies courses, but also courses in literature, cinema and media arts, the social sciences, art, music, and\nlanguages. Students may satisfy this requirement by choosing courses that focus on the history and culture of a\nsingle society or time period in human history and/or that represent a broad spectrum of different human societies\nand time periods.\nLanguage courses introduce students to the language of a different culture and provide insight into that culture in\nways that are not possible to achieve through detached study. At intermediate and advanced levels, students are\nable to explore the culture in depth, using the language itself to read, discuss, and write about its various aspects.\nEven at the most basic level, exposure to the language of a different culture prepares students to think and act in\nterms of living in a global community.\n \nIntermediate and advanced language courses prepare students for study abroad programs, which the College of\nArts and Science strongly recommends. A maximum of one course in this requirement may be satisfied through\nstudy abroad in a Vanderbilt-approved program. A summer study abroad program must earn 6 or more credit hours\nto satisfy this requirement.\n \nThe Global Education Office maintains a list of pre-approved programs.\n \nNote: All students who study abroad must register their travel in advance with Vanderbilt\u2019s international security\nprovider. Registration is completed on your behalf if you enroll in a program offered through the Global Education\nOffice. Otherwise, information is available on the GlobalVU website: vanderbilt.edu/global.\n \nPage 107 of 1019\nAll students must complete three courses in this category, irrespective of previous language study or proficiency in  \na language other than English. At least one of the three courses presented in fulfillment of this category must be a\nsecond-semester (or higher) language acquisition class taught at Vanderbilt University (or through the Duke\u2013UVa\u2013\nVanderbilt Partnership for Less Commonly Taught Languages), unless the student successfully demonstrates \nproficiency in a language other than English at or above the level achieved by second-semester language\nacquisition classes taught at Vanderbilt University. Students may demonstrate proficiency in a number of ways: SAT\nSubject Test scores (French, 540; German, 470; Hebrew, 530; Italian, 540; Japanese with Listening, 440; Latin, 530;\nSpanish, 520); by appropriate score on proficiency tests (written and oral) administered by the Tennessee Language\nCenter; or with AP or IB credit in a foreign language. The first semester of an introductory language acquisition class\nin any language a student has studied for at least two years in high school, or in which a student transfers credit\nfrom another institution, cannot be used in partial fulfillment of this requirement. Intensive elementary language\ncourses that cover the content of two semesters in one shall count as one course toward this category.\n \nStudents who, because of special ability and achievement, are admitted to the College of Arts and Science without\nthe normally required two years of one foreign language in high school must enroll in a foreign language course\nduring their first semester and must remain continuously enrolled until they successfully complete a full year of one\nforeign language. They must complete this requirement by the end of their fourth semester in the College of Arts\nand Science.\n \nc. History and Culture of the United States \u2014 US (1 course)\nThe study of the history and culture of the United States provides students with a basis for understanding the\nAmerican experience and the shaping of American values and viewpoints within the context of an increasingly global\nsociety. Interpreting history and culture in the broadest sense, options in this category include traditional history and\ncultural studies courses, but also courses in literature, cinema and media arts, the social sciences, art, and music,\nwhich illuminate historical periods or cultural themes in United States history. Students may satisfy this requirement\nby choosing a course that focuses on the history and culture of a single social group or time period in American\nhistory and/or that represents a broad spectrum of different social groups and time periods.\n \nd. Mathematics and Natural Sciences \u2014 MNS (3 courses, one of which must be a laboratory science)\nCourses in mathematics emphasize quantitative reasoning and prepare students to describe, manipulate, and\nevaluate complex or abstract ideas or arguments with precision. Skills in mathematical and quantitative reasoning\nprovide essential foundations for the study of natural and social sciences. Students are generally introduced to\nmathematical reasoning through the study of introductory courses in calculus or probability and statistics.\n \nCourses in the natural sciences engage students in hypothesis-driven quantitative reasoning that helps to explain\nnatural phenomena, the roles of testing and replication of experimental results, and the processes through which\nscientific hypotheses and theories are developed, modified, or abandoned in the face of more complete evidence, or\nintegrated into more general conceptual structures. Laboratory science courses engage students in methods of\nexperimental testing of hypotheses and analysis of data that are the hallmarks of the natural sciences. Natural\nscience courses prepare students to understand the complex interactions between science, technology, and society;\nteach students to apply scientific principles to everyday experience; and develop the capacity to distinguish\nbetween science and what masquerades as science.\n \ne. Social and Behavioral Sciences \u2014 SBS (2 courses)\nSocial scientists endeavor to study human behavior at the levels of individuals, their interactions with others, their\nsocietal structures, and their social institutions. The remarkable scope represented by these disciplines extends\nfrom studying the underpinnings of brain function to the dynamics of human social groups to the structures of\npolitical and economic institutions. The methods employed by social scientists are correspondingly broad, involving\napproaches as varied as mapping brain activity, discovering and charting ancient cultures, identifying the societal\nforces that shape individual and group behavior, and using mathematics to understand economic phenomena. By\nstudying how humans and societies function, students will learn about individual and societal diversity, growth, and\nchange.\nPage 108 of 1019\nf. Perspectives \u2014 P (1 course)\nCourses in Perspectives give significant attention to individual and cultural diversity, multicultural interactions,\nsexual orientation, gender, racial, ethical, and religious issues within a culture across time or between cultures,\nthereby extending the principles and methods associated with the liberal arts to the broader circumstances in which\nstudents live. These courses emphasize the relationship of divergent ethics and moral values to contemporary social\nissues and global conflicts. \n \nThe Major\nAll students must successfully complete a course of study leading to one of the approved major programs in the\nCollege of Arts and Science, or successfully complete an individually designed interdisciplinary major designed in\nconsultation with College of Arts and Science faculty and approved by the Committee on Individual Programs in the\nCollege of Arts and Science.\n \nAXLE Curriculum Course Distribution\nThe distribution of Arts and Science courses into AXLE categories is available in YES. Using the advanced-class-\nsearch dialog box, use the pull-down menu under \u201cClass Attributes\u201d to select an AXLE category.\n \nAXLE, the Major, and the Optional Minor\nCourses used to satisfy requirements of AXLE may also be used to satisfy requirements of the major or the optional\nminor.\n \nAdvanced Placement under AXLE\nWith the exception of basic English composition and the foreign language proficiency requirements, no AXLE\nrequirement may be fulfilled with any form of advanced placement credit (AP, IB, A-level, etc.).\n \nTransfer Credit under AXLE\nGenerally, only courses taken in the College of Arts and Science may be used toward AXLE; however, any college\ncourse credit earned prior to graduation from high school, and transfer credit earned before admission to\nVanderbilt, may be used toward fulfilling AXLE requirements.\n \nArea of Concentration\nDuring the junior and senior years, much of the student\u2019s work is concentrated in one large unit of intellectually\nrelated courses. The program of concentration may be arranged through a single major, an interdisciplinary major,\nor a double major. Each of the three options is described below. A triple major may be declared with the approval of\nthe Administrative Committee.\n \nMajor Field\nUnder this plan, the student majors in one of the recognized fields. There shall not be fewer than 27 credit hours in\nthe major field, but a given department may require up to 48 credit hours. Students may take more than the\nrequired number of credit hours in any major; any given department, however, may limit the total permissible credit\nPage 109 of 1019\nhours in a discipline.\n \nFor graduation, a student must have achieved a grade point average of at least 2.000 in all classes taken in the \nmajor. This set of courses includes all courses a student takes in the department or program of the major and all\ncourses a student takes outside the department or program that may count toward the major. All courses that are\nlisted as fulfilling credit hours required for the major, as listed in the Undergraduate Catalog, are included in\ncalculating the grade point average in the major.\n \nWithin the framework of these general requirements, each department has its own policies governing major work,\nwhich are published elsewhere in this catalog or otherwise available to students.\n \nAcademic programs of the College of Arts and Science are varied and broad in scope, with departmental majors\noffered in the following fields:\n \nAfrican American and Diaspora Studies\nHistory\nAnthropology\nHistory of Art and Architecture\nArchitecture and the Built Environment\nJewish Studies\nArt\nLaw, History, and Society\nAsian Studies\nMathematics\nBiological Sciences\nMedicine, Health, and Society\nChemistry\nMolecular and Cellular Biology\nCinema and Media Arts\nPhilosophy\nCommunication Studies\nPhysics\nEarth and Environmental Sciences\nPolitical Science\nEcology, Evolution, and Organismal Biology\nPsychology\nEconomics\nReligious Studies\nEnglish\nRussian Studies\nEnvironmental Sociology\nSociology\nFrench\nSpanish\nGender and Sexuality Studies\nSpanish and Portuguese\nGerman Studies\nTheatre\n \nDefined Interdisciplinary Programs\nStudents may also major in defined interdisciplinary programs (listed below). There shall not be fewer than 27 credit\nhours in the major field, but a given program may require up to 48 credit hours. The student must achieve at least a\n2.000 grade point average in all work taken in the major.\n \nAmerican Studies\nGerman and European Studies\nBiochemistry and Chemical Biology\nItalian and European Studies\nClassical and Mediterranean Studies\nLatin American Studies\nCommunication of Science and Technology\nLatino and Latina Studies\nEconomics and History\nNeuroscience\nEuropean Studies\nPublic Policy Studies\nEuropean Studies: Russia and Eastern Europe\nSpanish and European Studies\nFrench and European Studies\n \n \nPage 110 of 1019\nStudents may combine an interdisciplinary major with a major in one of the recognized fields listed at the beginning\nof this section.\n \nDeclaration of the Area of Concentration\nStudents may formally declare a major at any time during the third semester of residence and must do so no later\nthan the Friday before Spring Break of the fourth semester. The student selects a department or interdisciplinary\nprogram and contacts that department or program for assignment to an adviser. Students who wish to develop an\nindividually designed interdisciplinary program apply to the associate dean who chairs the Committee on Individual\nPrograms.\n \nEach fall a program is arranged that provides for consultation of sophomores with department chairs, for the\npurpose of helping students select a major. Sophomore students who have not declared a major should participate\nin this program if they intend to attain junior standing before the next spring.\n \nStudents should declare their intention to pursue specific majors by completing forms available in the Dean\u2019s Office\nof Undergraduate Education as well as the various departmental and program offices. Departments and programs\nassign advisers to students who declare majors in their respective areas. Students have the responsibility to know\nand satisfy all requirements for majors that they intend to complete. When the student\u2019s major has been registered,\naccess to the student\u2019s academic record is transferred from the pre-major adviser to the new major adviser, with\nwhom they should work closely.\n \nStudents may not add a major(s) past the fifth class-day of the first semester of the senior year.\n \nIndividually Designed Interdisciplinary Majors\nThis plan permits students to contract for an individually designed program of concentration consisting of at least\n48 credit hours of approved work. The program is constructed around a coherent academic purpose and may draw\ntogether the academic resources of a number of departments and schools. The program\u2019s purpose may include\ntopical, period, or area studies, and must be consistent with the philosophy underlying a liberal arts education (see\nthe \u201cWhat is Liberal Education?\u201d section of this catalog). The program should not be designed with a focus on pre-\nprofessional training  (e.g., pre-business, pre-law, or pre-medicine). The student may be required to achieve a\nstandard of proficiency in appropriately related areas such as foreign languages or mathematics in addition to the\n48 credit hours constituting the program of concentration.\n \nEach student must identify a major adviser who will offer advice and guidance. The major adviser must be a\nprofessor or full-time senior lecturer in the College of Arts and Science.\n \nThe student\u2019s plan for an individually designed interdisciplinary major is a statement of required courses.\nFurthermore, because of the nature of interdisciplinary majors, all courses that have previously been included in the\nstudent\u2019s plan are considered to be part of the major discipline. The student must achieve at least a 2.000 grade\npoint average in all courses that are (or have been) part of the plan.\n \nNormally, no more than three introductory-level courses will be counted toward the interdisciplinary major.\n \nStudents may not add a major(s) past the fifth class day of the first semester of the senior year.\nPage 111 of 1019\nDouble and Triple Majors\nThis program permits a student to concentrate in two or three fields, which may or may not be intellectually related.\nWith approval of the departments concerned, the student completes all of the requirements stipulated for the\nmajors. Triple majors require approval of the Administrative Committee.\n \nEach A&S major must include at least 24 credit hours that are being counted solely toward the major. This rule also\napplies to students who combine (in a double or triple major) a non-interdisciplinary major with an interdisciplinary\nmajor.\nStudents in the School of Engineering may use courses taken in the College of Arts & Science for relevant second\nmajors even if those courses also fulfill a School of Engineering degree requirement.\nApproved Second Majors Outside the College\nAll undergraduate courses, majors, and minors offered by Blair School of Music, School of Engineering, and Peabody\nCollege are approved for students in the College of Arts and Science. See the appropriate sections of the\nUndergraduate Catalog under each school for details. Arts and Science students with a second major from another\nVanderbilt undergraduate school must earn a minimum of 90 credit hours in Arts and Science. Consultation with the\nstudent\u2019s Arts and Science major adviser is especially important.\nAdditional Programs in the College of Arts and Science\nThe Optional Minor\nUndergraduate Research\nStudy Abroad Programs\nPre-Professional Studies\nMedicine\nDentistry\nNursing\nArchitecture\nEngineering\nLaw\nTeacher Education\nInternships\nFinding an Internship\nInterdisciplinary Internships\nDepartmental Internships\nCost of an Internship\nCombined B.A./M.A. (4+1) Program\nPrograms of Study\nAdmissions Overview\nAdvising\nPage 112 of 1019\nCurriculum\nScholarships and Financial Aid\n \n \nFor information on the College Scholars program and departmental honors, please see the section titled Honors.\n \nThe Optional Minor\nA minor is a program within a recognized area of knowledge offering students more than a casual introduction to the\narea but less than a major in it. Although the completion of a minor is not a degree requirement, students may elect\nto complete the courses specified for one or more minors. A student who completes all designated courses in a\nminor with a grade point average of at least 2.000 will have the minor entered on the transcript at the time of\ngraduation.\n \nMinors may be combined with any departmental major or interdisciplinary major, but minors may not be earned in\nthe department or program of the major. Each minor must, however, include at least 15 credit hours that are being\ncounted solely toward the minor. Courses may not be taken on a P/F basis if they are offered in the department of\nthe minor or if they are being counted toward an interdisciplinary minor (see Academic Regulations).\n \nMinors consist of a minimum of five courses of 3 or more credit hours each. Many minors require a greater number\nof credit hours and specific courses. When a minor is offered in a discipline that offers a major, only those courses\nthat count toward the major may be counted toward the minor.\n \nStudents should refer to the appropriate sections of this catalog for specific requirements. Minors available at\npresent are listed below.\n \nStudents should declare their intention to pursue specific minors by completing forms available in the Dean\u2019s Office\nof Undergraduate Education as well as the various departmental and program offices. Departments and programs\nassign advisers to students who declare minors in their respective areas. Students have the responsibility to know\nand satisfy all requirements for minors that they intend to complete.\n \nStudents may not add or change a minor after the final day of classes in the second semester of their senior year.\n \nOptional minors are offered in the following fields and interdisciplinary programs:\n \nPage 113 of 1019\nAfrican American and Diaspora\nStudies\nEnglish\nMediterranean Studies\nAmerican Studies\nEnvironmental and Sustainability\nStudies \nNanoscience and Nanotechnology** \nAnthropology\nEuropean Studies\nNeuroscience\nArabic Language\nFrench\nPhilosophy\nArchitecture and the Built\nEnvironment\nGender and Sexuality Studies \nPhysics\nArt\nGerman Studies\nPolitical Science\nAsian Studies\nHistory\nPortuguese\nAstronomy\nHistory of Architecture \nPsychology\nBiological Sciences\nIslamic Studies\nQuantum Information Science and\nEngineering\nBrazilian Studies\nItalian Studies \nReligious Studies\nChemistry\nJapanese Language and Culture\nRussian Studies\nChinese Language and Culture\nJewish Studies\nScientific Computing**\nCinema and Media Arts\nKorean Language and Culture \nSociology\nCommunication of Science and\nTechnology\nLatin American Studies\nSouth Asian Language and Culture\nCommunication Studies\nLatino and Latina Studies\nSpanish \nData Science*\nMathematics\nSports and Society\nEarth and Environmental Sciences\nMedicine, Health, and Society\nTheatre\nEconomics \nMediterranean Archaeology \nUndergraduate Business Minor ^\n \n* Administered by the four undergraduate schools\n**Administered by the School of Engineering in collaboration with the College of Arts and Science\n^Administered by the four undergraduate schools and the Owen Graduate School of Management\n \nApproved Minors Outside the College\nArts and Science students are permitted to pursue a second major and/or a minor that has been approved by the\nfaculties of the other Vanderbilt undergraduate schools: the Blair School of Music, the School of Engineering, and\nPeabody College of Education and Human Development. See the appropriate sections of the Undergraduate Catalog\nunder each school for details. Minors may not be earned in the department or program of the major.\n \nUndergraduate Research\nAll students have ample opportunity to participate in faculty research projects or to pursue research projects\nindependently, both on campus and at remote sites. Such research has led to the publication of coauthored or\nstudent-authored papers and other presentations to the scholarly community. Summer and academic year research\nby undergraduates in all fields may be subsidized by the university or the College of Arts and Science. Students\nshould contact the director of undergraduate studies in the field of interest for more information.\n \nStudy Abroad Programs\nVanderbilt offers study programs for all undergraduate students from Arts and Science, Blair School of Music, School\nof Engineering, and Peabody College to provide undergraduates immediate contact with cultures different from their\nown and to aid in the mastery of foreign languages. Students interested in applying for study abroad should consult\ntheir advisers to determine whether all degree requirements can be completed on schedule.\n \nPage 114 of 1019\nBrochures on all approved programs are available in the Global Education Office in Room 115, Student Life Center.\nGEO also maintains a website, vanderbilt.edu/geo. The study abroad programs are described in more detail in the\nSpecial Programs for Undergraduates section of this catalog.\n \nWhen choosing programs in a city for study abroad, College of Arts and Science students may only apply to the\nVanderbilt-approved overseas program(s). The College only accepts credit from international schools and programs\nthat have been approved by Vanderbilt faculty, and for which the University has a contract or agreement.\n \nPre-Professional Studies\nMedicine\nStudents interested in the study of medicine should plan their undergraduate programs in consultation with Dr.\nMichelle Grundy, health professions adviser. There is no formal premedical program of courses in the College of Arts\nand Science or elsewhere at Vanderbilt. Each student should plan a program to meet individual needs. The program\nshould include whatever courses may be necessary to meet medical school admission requirements, all courses\nrequired for the major, all AXLE requirements, and elective options. Students may choose majors from any of the\nfour undergraduate colleges, and may elect to pursue a double major or an interdisciplinary program of\nconcentration.\n \nA student who plans to apply for admission to the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, as well as other medical\nschools, may choose either of the following options:\n \n1. A student may qualify for admission with a B.A. degree, whether completed in three years or in four. Minimum\nrequirements for admission generally would be met by completing at least two semesters of English, four semesters\nof chemistry including organic, two semesters of biology, two semesters of physics, and at least one semester of\ncalculus/math. Since prerequisites may vary across medical schools, students are urged to consult the online\nresource, Medical School Admission Requirements (MSAR) published by the American Association of Medical Schools\n(at aamc.org) for school-specific information.\n \nIn light of the Medical College Admissions Test (MCAT) changes that took effect in 2015, it is recommended that\nstudents take one semester of biochemistry and one semester of introductory statistics. Additionally, through course\nwork or self-directed study, students will need to be knowledgeable in basic concepts of psychology, sociology, and\nbioethics.\n \nFor more information, students are advised to visit the website of the Health Professions Advisory Office\n(vanderbilt.edu/hpao) and refer to the links for 1) \u201cPremedical Preparation\u201d and 2) \u201cThreading a path through\npremedical expectations.\u201d\n \n2. A student may qualify as a three-year student in the senior-in-absentia program (see Senior-in-Absentia in this\ncatalog).\n \nDentistry\nStudents interested in predental studies should plan their undergraduate program in consultation with Dr. Michelle\nGrundy, health professions adviser. There is no formal predental program of courses at Vanderbilt. Predental studies\nshould include courses necessary to meet dental school admission requirements, all courses required for the major,\nall AXLE requirements, and elective options. Students may choose majors from any of the four undergraduate\ncolleges. They may also elect a double major or an interdisciplinary program of concentration. A student may apply\nPage 115 of 1019\nto dental school under the senior-in-absentia program (see Senior-in-Absentia in this catalog) or apply for admission\nafter three years of college work without a degree.\n \nAny student contemplating application to dental school should take at least two semesters of English, four\nsemesters of chemistry including organic, two semesters of biology, two semesters of physics, and at least one\nsemester of calculus/math. Since prerequisites may vary across dental schools, students are urged to consult the\nADEA Official Guide to Dental Schools published by the American Association of Dental Schools.\n \nNursing\nStudents interested in developing a program that could lead to a master of science in nursing are advised to consult\nthe Office of Admissions in the School of Nursing.\n \nArchitecture\nUndergraduate students in the College of Arts and Science expecting to pursue architecture at the graduate level\nshould complete at least one year of analytic geometry and calculus and one year of physics. Students may select\nany major  but would want to include courses that emphasize a broad sense of art and architectural history,\nincluding courses in studio art. Before applying to specific schools of architecture, they would develop a portfolio of\ncreative work. Further information is available from the pre-architecture advisers: Professor Vesna Pavlovi\u0107,\nDepartment of Art, and Professor Kevin Murphy, Department of the History of Art and Architecture.\n \nEngineering\nUndergraduate students in the College of Arts and Science expecting to pursue engineering at the graduate level\nshould normally major in a natural science or mathematics and, at a minimum, should complete two years of\ncalculus or its equivalent, one year each of chemistry and physics, and at least an additional year of a natural\nscience or mathematics. A minimum of one year of computer science is highly desirable. Students should seek\nspecific information concerning admission from the engineering school of their choice as early as possible,\npreferably by the end of the sophomore year, to assure optimum preparation for entry into that school. Standards\nfor admission vary, but usually a 3.00 average or better is required.\n \nLaw\nThere is no formal program of prelaw studies at Vanderbilt. Most law schools have no specific requirements for a\nprelaw curriculum but place great emphasis on the development of the student\u2019s ability to read and comprehend\naccurately, thoroughly, and rapidly; to speak and write clearly and correctly; to think precisely; and to analyze\ncomplex situations and weigh and appraise their several elements. The development of analytical skills and of\nmature study habits is vital. A broad cultural background is important\u2014since law touches life at every point, every\nsubject in the college curriculum may bear on the lawyer\u2019s work. Students interested in the study of law should plan\ntheir undergraduate programs in consultation with Dean Carrie Russell, prelaw adviser, in the Dean\u2019s Office of\nUndergraduate Education.\n \nTeacher Education\nDetails will be found in Licensure for Teaching in the Peabody College section of this catalog.\n \nInternships\nStudents may earn academic credit for the work of internships in the College of Arts and Science on a Pass/Fail basis\nPage 116 of 1019\nthrough interdisciplinary or departmental internships. Credit hours earned will not count toward major or minor\nrequirements or toward AXLE, but will count as part of the total credit hours required for graduation. Students obtain\ntheir own placement and faculty adviser who works with them to develop a list of readings or research agenda for\nthe internship, which must be approved by the director of internships in the College of Arts and Science (Associate\nDean Daniel Morgan). The necessary forms for earning academic credit for an internship may be obtained from the\nDean\u2019s Office of Undergraduate Education in 350 Buttrick Hall, although students register for internships through\ntheir respective school. The deadline for submitting registration forms to the office of Dean Jones for internship\ncourses taken during summer term and fall semester is May 1. Students expecting to intern during the spring\nsemester should submit registration forms by January 1.\n \nFinding an Internship\nStudents searching for an internship opportunity locally or elsewhere should contact the Career Center.\n \nInterdisciplinary Internships\nINDS 3880 (fall, spring), 3884 (summer). 1 credit hour (repeatable)\n \nAny student who is at least a sophomore and in good academic standing may earn one credit hour per semester or\nsummer for an internship under this designation. This course may be repeated twice for a maximum of 3 credit\nhours exclusively on a Pass/Fail basis.\n \nDepartmental Internships\nMaximum of 15 credit hours (may be taken only once)\n \nUnder this option students from any discipline may earn academic credit for internships in the departments listed\nbelow if they meet the minimum GPA requirements and have 6 credit hours of prior work in the department in which\nthey wish to intern. Students are responsible for securing a faculty adviser for the internship and developing an\nacademic plan of work for the internship opportunity, both of which must be approved by the director of\nundergraduate studies in the department in which the internship is housed. (In some instances, the DUS will serve\nas the faculty adviser for all internships taken in that discipline.) All internships under this designation are taken\nconcurrently with a research and/or readings course. The latter is taken on a graded basis and may count toward\nrequirements for a major or minor. Students should consult the director of undergraduate studies in the department\nof interest to obtain additional information about internships in that discipline. The following departments offer up to\n15 credit hours of academic credit per semester or summer for the following courses (internship courses are offered\nduring FALL, SPRING, and SUMMER sessions):\n \nAADS 3880\u20133881. 3880: Internship Training [1\u20139], 3881: Internship Readings and Research [3\u20136].\nAMER 3880\u20133881. 3880: Internship Training [1\u20136], 3881: Internship Readings and Research [3\u20136].\nANTH 3880\u20133881. 3880: Internship Training [1\u20139], 3881: Internship Readings and Research [1\u20136].\nBCB 3880\u20133881. 3880: Internship Training [1\u20139], 3881: Internship Readings and Research [1\u20136].\nCLAS 3880\u20133881. 3880: Internship Training [1\u20139], 3881: Internship Readings and Research [1\u20136].\nCMA 3880\u20133881. 3880: Internship Training [1\u20139], 3881: Internship Readings and Research [1\u20136].\nEES 3880\u20133881. 3880: Internship Training [1\u20139], 3881: Internship Readings and Research [3\u20136].\nFREN 3880\u20133881. 3880: Internship Training in France [1], 3881: Internship Readings and Research in France [3].\nGSS (formerly WGS) 3880, 3882\u20133883. 3880: Internship Training [1\u20139], 3882: Internship Readings [1\u20133], 3883:\nPage 117 of 1019\nInternship Research [1\u20133].\nHART 3880, 3883. 3880: Internship Training [1\u20139], 3883: Internship Research [1\u20133].\nHIST 3880, 3882\u20133883. 3880: Internship Training [3\u20139], 3882: Internship Readings [3], 3883: Internship Research\n[3].\nJS 3880, 3883. 3880: Internship Training [1\u20133], 3883: Internship Research [3].\nLAS 3880\u20133881. 3880: Internship Training [1\u20139], 3881: Internship Readings and Research [3-6].\nMHS 3880\u20133881. 3880: Internship Training [1\u20139], 3881: Internship Readings and Research [1\u20136].\nPSCI 3880, 3881. 3880: Internship Training [1\u20139], 3881: Internship Readings and Research [1-6].\nPSY 3880\u20133881. 3880: Internship Training [1\u20139], 3881: Internship Readings and Research [3\u20136].\nRUSS 3880\u20133881. 3880: Internship Training [1\u20139], 3881: Internship Readings and Research [3\u20136].\nSOC 3880\u20133881. 3880: Internship Training [1\u20139], 3881: Internship Readings and Research [3\u20136].\nSPAN 3880\u20133881. 3880: Internship Training in Spain [1], 3881: Internship Readings and Research in Spain [3].\n \nMore complete information regarding departmental internship courses may be found in the course descriptions in\nthis catalog.\n \nCost of an Internship\nInternships taken during the fall or spring semester will fall under the normal tuition charge unless the student falls\nbelow 12 or exceeds 18 credit hours during the semester. In both instances, the hourly tuition charge will apply with\npermission for an underload/overload from the appropriate academic dean. Students will be charged for internships\ntaken during summer on the basis of the hourly tuition rate for summer school unless approved in advance to\nreceive the internship subsidy (see the Career Center website).\n \nCombined B.A./M.A. (4+1) Program\nThe College of Arts and Science offers students in many departments and programs the opportunity to earn both the\nbachelor\u2019s degree and the master\u2019s degree in a shorter period of time and at less cost than is normally the case.\n \nExceptional students in the College of Arts and Science can obtain both degrees in an expedited period, typically\nwithin, but not less than, five years.\nThe usual period of study for both the bachelor\u2019s and the master\u2019s degree is six years. Through the 4+1 option, the\nstudent and her or his adviser plan a five-year program of study. It is important to note that there is no provision for\nobtaining both degrees in a period shorter than five years. The program is intended for selected students for whom\nthe master\u2019s degree is sufficient preparation for their career goals, is desirable as a goal in itself, or is viewed as\nadditional preparation before pursuing a doctorate or a professional degree.\n \nThe areas of study available for the Combined B.A./M.A. (4+1) option within Arts and Science are determined by\nindividual departments and programs, which also determine the policies and guidelines to be followed. Students will\nbe admitted to the Combined B.A./M.A. program only by the invitation and the approval of the department or\nprogram.\n \nPrograms of Study\nPage 118 of 1019\nThe 4+1 option is currently available in the following departments and programs: English; French; German; History;\nHistory of Art and Architecture; Latin American Studies; Mathematics; Medicine, Health, and Society; Philosophy;\nPolitical Science; and Psychology. Students are welcome to discuss the Combined B.A./M.A. (4+1) option with any of\nthese departments and programs.\n \nAdmissions Overview\nThe Combined B.A./M.A program allows Vanderbilt University students to study for both degrees typically, but not\nnecessarily, in the same department. Undergraduates with strong academic records may apply for admission to the\nprogram after the first semester of their junior year. Qualifying students are normally accepted into the program in\nthe second semester of the junior year.\n \nTo apply for admission, students will first consult with the Dean\u2019s Office of Undergraduate Education (350 Buttrick\nHall), and then submit to the prospective graduate department or program a \u201cPetition to Apply to the Combined\nB.A./M.A. (4+1) Degree Program\u201d (available at as.vanderbilt.edu/academics/specialdegree/4plus1.php), a statement\nof purpose, a formal application to the Graduate School, a preliminary program proposal, two letters of\nrecommendation from Vanderbilt faculty, and a current transcript. Application forms are available for download or\ncan be completed online at vanderbilt.edu/gradschool. GRE scores or other admissions requirements may be\nspecified by the prospective department. Admission to the 4+1 option is highly selective. An accomplished\nacademic record, a demonstrated commitment to pursue graduate study, and a strong endorsement from\nVanderbilt faculty are key elements to the successful applicant. Students will be provisionally accepted as graduate\nstudents, pending completion of all undergraduate requirements. Graduate student status will apply in the fifth\nyear.\n \nAdvising\nProspective students should discuss with one of their advisers general information on the program and whether this\nprogram is appropriate to their long-term goals. All students are encouraged to discuss their plans and goals with\ntheir undergraduate pre-major and major adviser. Especially in cases where the intended graduate program differs\nfrom the undergraduate major, the student is further encouraged to seek advice from the advisers in the graduate\nprogram.\n \nCurriculum\nStudents in a 4+1 program must satisfy all requirements for both degrees. Advanced Placement (AP) credits will\noften be used toward satisfying general curriculum requirements, for a maximum of 18 credit hours. The principal\ndistinction between this program and the standard graduate program is two-fold: (1) students are allowed to take\nmaster\u2019s courses while completing the bachelor\u2019s degree, and (2) students are thereby enabled to complete both\ndegrees within five years.\n \nIn order to complete the program in five years, students will be expected to complete most, if not all, of the\nrequirements for their undergraduate degree by the end of the first semester of the senior year. Until all\nbaccalaureate requirements are fulfilled, the student will follow College of Arts and Science undergraduate policies\nand procedures. It is also suggested that students begin taking graduate courses toward the master\u2019s degree in the\nsecond semester of the senior year. Most graduate programs participating in this option have a non-thesis plan of\nstudy requiring 30 graduate credit hours in addition to the requirements for the undergraduate degree. An average\nload per semester as a graduate student is 9\u201312 credit hours.\n \nScholarships and Financial Aid\nStudents who are receiving scholarships or other forms of financial aid as a Vanderbilt undergraduate are advised\nthat such aid applies in most cases only toward the completion of the bachelor\u2019s degree or the first four years of\ntheir studies (which may include their taking some graduate courses during their senior year). Students wishing to\nPage 119 of 1019\npursue the 4+1 option should seek support for their fifth year of study through student loans and other financial aid.\n \nFor additional information, contact A&S Deans\u2019 Office, 350 Buttrick Hall, or consult the website\nas.vanderbilt.edu/academics/specialdegree/4plus1.php.\nHonors in the College of Arts and Science\nFounder's Medal\nLatin Honors Designation\nCollege Scholars Program\nDepartmental Honors\nDean's List\nPhi Beta Kappa\nHonor Societies for First-Year Students\nOther Awards and Prizes\nFounder\u2019s Medal\nThe Founder\u2019s Medal, signifying first honors, was endowed by Commodore Cornelius Vanderbilt as one of his gifts to\nthe university. The recipient is named by the Dean after consideration of faculty recommendations and overall\nacademic achievements, as well as grade point averages of the year\u2019s highest ranking summa cum laude graduates.\n \nLatin Honors Designation\nHonors noted on diplomas and published in the Commencement program are earned as follows:\n \nSumma Cum Laude. Students whose grade point average equals or exceeds that of the top 5 percent of the previous\nthree years\u2019 Arts and Science graduating seniors.\nMagna Cum Laude. Students whose grade point average equals or exceeds that of the next 8 percent of the previous\nthree years\u2019 Arts and Science graduating seniors.\nCum Laude. Students whose grade point average equals or exceeds that of the next 12 percent of the previous three\nyears\u2019 Arts and Science graduating seniors.\n \nCollege Scholars Program\nThe College Scholars Program is the honors program for the College of Arts and Science. All first-year students in the\nCollege of Arts & Science are invited to apply at the end of their first semester. Students are selected to participate\nin the College Scholars program based on their academic record and achievements from their first semester on\ncampus. These students have the opportunity to pursue advanced scholarly work in honors seminars and enriched\ncourses or independent-studies projects. The College Scholars program is open only to Arts and Science students.\n \nCollege Scholars may achieve the designation \u201cHonors in the College of Arts and Science\u201d on their diplomas by\nacquiring fifteen \u201chonors points\u201d in the program. The honors points system encourages breadth and depth. Students\naccomplish these goals by taking honors seminars in several AXLE categories and by doing independent projects\n(independent studies, enriching courses, departmental honors research, internships, service, and creative projects).\nA maximum of thirteen points may be earned in honors seminars, and a minimum of two research projects must be\ncompleted to earn fifteen points. Students must earn a grade of \u201cB\u201d or better in classes that earn honors points. To\nremain in good standing in the program, students must maintain a minimum grade point average of 3.000.\nPage 120 of 1019\nFurther information on the College Scholars program and honors in the College of Arts and Science may be obtained\nfrom Associate Dean Dan Morgan.\n \nDepartmental Honors\nTo encourage individual development and independent study within their field, many departments and\ninterdisciplinary programs of the College of Arts and Science offer honors programs for selected, superior\ncandidates. Students often begin departmental honors work in the junior year, but some projects start in the senior\nyear. To qualify for consideration, students must have (a) attained a minimum grade point average of 3.300 in all\nwork previously taken for credit and in the major, and (b) exhibited to the department(s) and/or interdisciplinary\nprogram(s) other evidence of the student\u2019s capacity for independent study. Some departments and interdisciplinary\nprograms require higher grade point averages in all work previously taken for credit and/or in the major. Formal\nadmission is by the director of honors study in the Dean\u2019s Office of Undergraduate Education after nomination by\nthe department(s) and/or interdisciplinary program(s) concerned.\n \nRequirements to complete departmental honors vary from department to department (see descriptions in the\nappropriate department sections of this catalog). Candidates are required to demonstrate some degree of originality\nand maturity in the methods of independent investigation, analysis, and criticism, and skill in the written\npresentation of independent work. This standard usually requires a senior thesis but may be satisfied, in\ndepartments that have gained approval of this procedure, by a series of briefer critical papers.\n \nDepartmental honors work culminates in an examination given in the second semester of the senior year. The\nexamination shall be both oral and written except in departments where honors students must take all courses\nrequired of standard majors in addition to those required of honors students. These departments have the option of\nmaking the examination either oral or both oral and written. The examination shall be conducted by a committee\nwith a majority of examiners who have not participated in the candidate\u2019s honors work. Where feasible, examiners\nfrom other institutions may be included. The examination shall cover the thesis and specific fields of the\nindependent work and may, at the discretion of the department, include all of the major work. Successful candidates\nare awarded honors or highest honors in their field, and this designation appears on their diplomas.\n \nDean\u2019s List\nThe Dean\u2019s List recognizes outstanding academic performance in a semester. Students are named to the Dean\u2019s List\nwhen they earn a grade point average of at least 3.500 while carrying 12 or more graded credit hours, with no\ntemporary or missing grades in any course (credit or non-credit), and no grade of F. A student must be in a degree-\ngranting school.\n \nPhi Beta Kappa\nThe Alpha Chapter of Phi Beta Kappa in the state of Tennessee honors scholarly attainments in the liberal arts and\nsciences and annually elects seniors and juniors to membership during the spring semester.\n \nSeniors who have completed at least 60 credit hours in the College of Arts and Science and earned a cumulative\ngrade point average of 3.65 or higher are eligible for consideration, as are juniors who have completed at least 70\ncredit hours at Vanderbilt with a cumulative grade point average of at least 3.90. Juniors must have completed most\nAXLE requirements by the end of their junior year. For calculating credit hours and judging residence requirements,\nthe chapter treats foreign study programs in the same manner as does the College of Arts and Science.\n \nAttainment of the minimum required grade point average does not guarantee election. Membership in Phi Beta\nKappa is based on a demonstration of scholarly achievements, broad cultural interests, and high moral character.\nPage 121 of 1019\nThe scholarly work must emphasize liberal rather than applied or professional studies. As a guideline, for seniors at\nleast 90 credit hours must qualify as liberal. Grades earned in applied (vocational) or professional course work are\nnot counted in computing the grade point average. The breadth of a candidate\u2019s program, as shown by the number\nand variety of courses taken outside the major, is also considered.\n \nPhi Beta Kappa has long emphasized the importance of mathematics and foreign language in a liberal education. In\nkeeping with this tradition, the chapter considers only those students who have demonstrated proficiency in these\nareas beyond the AXLE graduation requirements. Proficiency in reading, writing, and speaking a foreign language is\ntypically demonstrated by passing a course in a language at a level at least one semester beyond the AXLE\nrequirements. Courses must be taken on a graded rather than a P/F basis. The foreign language requirement may\nbe satisfied with College Board SAT Subject, Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, or Tennessee\nLanguage Center test scores.\n \nMathematics proficiency may be demonstrated by completing two semesters of calculus or one semester of calculus\nand one semester of statistics. Courses must be taken on a graded rather than a P/F basis. The mathematics\nrequirement may be satisfied with Advanced Placement, International Baccalaureate, or A-Level exam credit, but\nnot College Board SAT Subject test scores.\n \nIn no event may the total number of persons elected from any senior class exceed 10 percent of the class, and from\nany junior class exceed six persons. Eligible juniors who are not elected are reconsidered for membership in their\nsenior year.\n \nRefer to the chapter website my.vanderbilt.edu/phibetakappa for additional information and detailed eligibility\ncriteria.\n \nHonor Societies for First-Year Students\nFirst-year students who earn a grade point average of 3.500 or better for their first semester are eligible for\nmembership in the Vanderbilt chapters of Phi Eta Sigma and Alpha Lambda Delta.\n \nOther Awards and Prizes\nMORRIS H.

Graduates of the Blair School are recognized as superior artists and scholars distinguished by their global\nmindsets, broad interdisciplinary competencies, and unyielding commitments to advocacy, entrepreneurship, and\neducation.\n \nThe Blair School has been an integral part of Nashville\u2019s musical environment since its founding in 1964 by the Justin\nand Valere Potter Foundation through a bequest of Valere Blair Potter. In 1981 the school was merged with\nVanderbilt following the university\u2019s decision to develop an excellent program in music. Studies leading to the\nprofessional bachelor of music in performance were initiated in 1986.\n \nThe Bachelor of Music degree program includes majors in performance, composition, jazz studies, and integrated\nstudies. The performance major is available in any orchestral instrument, piano, saxophone, euphonium, and voice.\nThe major in composition emphasizes analytical skills as well as the development of students\u2019 creativity. The jazz\nstudies major offers a focus on American and non-Western music traditions while also developing the core\nfundamentals of Western music common to all Blair majors. The integrated studies major combines the study of\ncomposition or a performance area with an additional concentration in music and forms the basis for a five-year\nprogram in teacher education offered cooperatively with Peabody College. In the Bachelor of Musical Arts degree\nprogram, composers and performers complete an in-depth music study in addition to a field outside of music.\n \nA non-professional 31-hour liberal arts music major makes it possible for students outside the Blair School to choose\nmusic as a second major. Students in other schools and colleges of the university also may pursue a minor in music,\nmusic composition, musicology/ethnomusicology, or music performance. And Blair offers a remarkable variety of\nelectives for students who wish to enrich their studies with credit in music courses, ensembles, or performance\ninstruction, or to select music as an extracurricular activity.\n \nPage 128 of 1019\nBlair School of Music is home to internationally known faculty soloists and ensembles, and Blair\u2019s performers,\ncomposers, ethnomusicologists, and musicologists are among the most respected in their fields. Members of the\nfaculty ensembles provide private performance instruction and coach chamber music ensembles and performance\nclasses. The faculty's dedication to teaching and a low student/faculty ratio provide students the personal attention\nthat fosters maximum musical growth and understanding. The school is committed to its goal of developing students\nwho are among the most articulate, culturally aware, and artistically sensitive of any graduates in the country.\n \nFacilities\nThe Blair building incorporates innovative developments in acoustical design and engineering. It contains teaching\nstudios and faculty offices, classrooms, rehearsal halls, practice rooms, library, administrative offices, technology\nand keyboard labs, and concert venues. The 272-seat Steve and Judy Turner Recital Hall is the locus for student\nrecitals and concerts and master classes by faculty members and visiting artists held on a regular basis. It also\nhouses the Dobson Organ Opus 92 (2014), designed in the tradition of eighteenth-century eastern German organs\nnot unlike those Bach knew, with additions and accommodations for twenty-first century use. Opened in spring\n2002, the 609-seat Ingram Hall garnered immediate acclaim for its superb acoustics, its visual beauty, and its\nenhancement of the school\u2019s ability to host and produce orchestra, opera, and other major concert events.\n \nThe Anne Potter Wilson Music Library is a division of the Jean and Alexander Heard Libraries. The collection, begun\nin 1947, was moved from Peabody College to its new and permanent home at Blair in the summer of 1985. Named\nto honor Anne Potter Wilson by the Vanderbilt Board of Trust in 1987, the 12,000-square-foot library holds more\nthan 116,000 books, scores, sound and video recordings, and subscriptions to journals and online music databases.\nIt is equipped with a seminar room, listening and viewing stations, computer workstations, and study facilities. A\nvariety of equipment is available for check out including laptops, microphones, phone chargers, midi keyboards,\nheadphones, and umbrellas. Music librarians and staff are available to assist users with music research and finding\nresources for performance, study, or instruction.\n \nThe Blair Concert Series\nThe Blair Concert Series offers a broad array of music performances to the university community and the region.\nNational and international artists and ensembles, the Blair faculty, including resident ensembles and soloists, and\nstudent ensembles and performers are all featured. All student recitals are open to the public. More than 350\nconcerts are presented at the school each year, and most are free of charge, as a gift to the community.\n \nA milestone in the Blair School's history was \u201cThe Blair Commissions: Music for the 21st Century,\u201d a project funded\nby the James Stephen Turner Family Charitable Foundation, which has commissioned several important works by\nrenowned composers from 2005 through 2019.

The curriculum, which provides\nmaximum flexibility for each student, requires a minimum of 30 hours (33 hours for composition majors), satisfied\nthrough required categories as noted below. Students electing a second major outside of music complete only the\nBlair liberal arts core; they are not expected to fulfill the core requirements (such as AXLE) of another Vanderbilt\nschool or college. Hours earned toward the Blair liberal arts core may also be counted toward a second major or\nminor, if appropriate. Students admitted with a deficiency relative to high school credits must plan their liberal arts\nwork to overcome the deficiency. 1001 courses do not count for liberal arts core credit.\nEnglish/writing (6 hours)\nStudents must complete writing course MUSL 2200W during the first year.

Students who are approved to student teach will receive notification of their student teaching\nplacements no later than during the Student Teacher Orientation at the beginning of the student teaching semester.\n \nAll Vanderbilt teacher education programs are approved by the Council for the Accreditation of Educator Preparation\n(CAEP). \n \n3+2 B.Mus.Arts/MBA Blair-to-Owen Program\nThe five-year dual-degree program between the Blair School of Music and the Owen Graduate School of\nManagement allows a small cohort of particularly motivated students to overlap their undergraduate course work\nwith work toward the MBA, facilitating the earning of both the undergraduate and graduate degrees in five years\n(ten semesters). By combining three and one-half years in Vanderbilt\u2019s Blair School of Music with one and one-half\nyears of study in the Owen School, students may obtain both the bachelor of musical arts and the master of business\nadministration in five years. The baccalaureate from the Blair School is awarded at the end of the fourth year, and\nthe MBA from the Owen School after the fifth year. Students interested in pursuing this program must be enrolled in\nthe musical arts degree.\n \nRequired course work includes the normal Blair course work for the musical arts degree, for a minimum of 63 credit\nhours in music. The liberal arts core will also follow the requirements for the major, but must include the following\nspecific requirements:\n \nCalculus (1 semester)\nStatistics, e.g., ECON 1500: Economic Statistics\nECON 1010: Principles of Macroeconomics\nECON 1020: Principles of Microeconomics\nECON 3012: Microeconomics\n \nA curriculum plan, including recommended electives, is provided in the Blair Student Handbook. \n \nStudents must apply to the Owen School for admission to the five-year program during their junior year. Students\nshould apply in Round 1 of the MBA application cycle (typically early October) of the junior year, and early\napplication and a standardized test score (e.g., GMAT, GRE) are recommended. Acceptance into the five-year\nprogram is extremely competitive and requires advanced standing earned in undergraduate courses. Being deficient\nPage 163 of 1019\nin full-time work experience, the 3+2 student must enhance their portfolio with an internship and outstanding\nacademic performance, and also show a strong commitment to a rigorous business education. The Summer\nBusiness Institute (Accelerator), as administered by the Owen Graduate School of Management, is strongly\nrecommended for 3+2 applicants prior to matriculating at Owen. The successful applicant will bring an\naccomplished academic record (normally a GPA of 3.3 or better), satisfactory internship or work experience, an\nability to articulate his or her own preparedness for the work environment, and a strong endorsement from\nVanderbilt faculty.\n \nStudents who are accepted to the 3+2 program will remain registered as B.Mus.Arts students through fall of senior\nyear, and will register as Owen students in spring of senior year. Academically, students will take a full load of\nbusiness courses both in fall and spring of senior year while completing the final B.Mus.Arts degree requirements\n(normally, lessons and ensembles). Students must complete a minimum of 62 credit hours at Owen over four\nsemesters. Fifteen hours (normally in fall of the senior year) of Owen School courses approved by Blair may be\ncounted toward completion of the undergraduate degree. Students with questions may contact Liz Scowden\n(liz.scowden@vanderbilt.edu) in the Owen Academic and Student Affairs Office. The completion of the B.Mus.Arts\ndegree requirements prior to fall of the student\u2019s fifth year is required for continuation in the MBA program.\n \nTuition and Financial Aid\nThe scholarship or other financial aid commitment of the Blair School will not be continued automatically beyond the\nseventh semester for students enrolled in the dual-degree program. Eighth-semester financial aid is the student\u2019s\nresponsibility. Students should notify the Owen School with their application if they are interested in being a\ncandidate for an Owen scholarship during their MBA studies. Early application is recommended. Need-based aid will\nstill apply.\n \nStudents pay tuition to the undergraduate school for the fall semester of their fourth year, after which all tuition is\npaid to Owen (and reflects graduate school tuition rates). The Blair School of Music will waive fees for the required\nperformance instruction during spring of the fourth year to facilitate completion of the B.Mus.Arts requirements.\nHonors in the Blair School of Music\nFounder's Medal\nAcademic Honors Designation\nHonors Program in Musicology and Ethnomusicology\nDean's List\nPi Kappa Lambda\nAwards and Prizes\nFounder\u2019s Medal\nThe Founder\u2019s Medal, signifying first honors, was endowed by Commodore Cornelius Vanderbilt as one of his gifts to\nthe university.

Classes\noffering engineering instruction began in 1879, and seven years later Engineering was made a separate unit with its\nPage 170 of 1019\nown dean. The school\u2019s program emphasizes the relationship of the engineering profession to society and prepares\nengineers to be socially aware as well as technically competent.\n \nThe mission of the School of Engineering is threefold: to produce intellectual leaders, entrepreneurs, and innovators\nby recruiting the best students and providing them a top-notch education; to deliver scholarship of the highest\ncaliber, published in the most visible venues, addressing important societal problems; and to be a leader in\nentrepreneurship and innovation, in Tennessee, the U.S., and globally.\n \nThe school strives to meet the undergraduate education portion of its mission by offering degree programs in fields\nof engineering relevant to the needs of society. An objective of these programs is to provide a technical education\nintegrated with strong humanities, fine arts, and social sciences subject matter to provide the requisite foundation\nfor lifelong learning. The availability of second majors and minors in subject areas in other schools and colleges of\nthe university increases opportunities for engineering students to enhance their education by pursuing studies in\nthe non-technical disciplines. Engineering students take close to 50 percent of their courses outside of the School of\nEngineering and associate daily with peers from other schools and colleges within the university.\n \nAnother objective is to prepare students who intend to enter engineering practice upon graduation and those who\nwill continue their studies at the graduate level in engineering or in other professional fields. To this end, our\nprograms emphasize mathematics and engineering sciences with significant exposure to engineering design and\nhands-on laboratory experiences.\n \nA large fraction of the student body is destined for management positions early in their working careers. To meet\nthese students\u2019 needs, the Engineering Management program offers a well-integrated minor.\n \nStudents at all levels have the opportunity to work with faculty in the generation of new knowledge. Those planning\nfor graduate studies and research are especially encouraged to participate in individual topics and research courses\nto fulfill that desire. Engineering students also participate in summer research programs of the university and of the\nschool.\n \nFacilities\nThe School of Engineering is housed in five main buildings with several satellite facilities. William W. Featheringill\nHall houses a three-story atrium designed for student interaction and social events, more than fifty teaching and\nresearch laboratories with the latest equipment and computer resources, and project rooms. The Engineering and\nScience Building is an eight-story state-of-the-art building that houses the Wond'ry at the Innovation Pavilion, the\nFrist Center for Autism and Innovation, numerous research labs, interactive classrooms, clean rooms, and space for\nstudents to work, study, and socialize. Olin Hall, which is attached to the Engineering and Science building, houses\nChemical and Biomolecular Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, and Materials Science, several classrooms, and\nresearch and teaching laboratories. School administrative offices and several classrooms are located on the ground\nfloor of the Science and Engineering Building in Stevenson Center, which also houses the Biomedical Engineering\ndepartment on the 8th and 9th floors. Jacobs Hall, which flanks Featheringill Hall, contains laboratories, offices, and\nclassrooms serving the Civil and Environmental Engineering, and Electrical and Computer Engineering departments.\nLabs, offices, and meeting spaces for Computer Science are also housed at 17th & DeFord Bailey, a building that\nserves as a hub for Computer Science and Data Science. Several satellite facilities are also part of the Engineering\nSchool: the W. M. Keck Free-Electron Laser Center building, housing the labs and offices of the Biomedical Photonics\nCenter; the Laboratory for Systems Integrity and Reliability (LASIR), an off-campus hangar-style facility dedicated to\nscaling up experiments to realistic and full size that houses a wind tunnel and military aircraft; the Vanderbilt\nInstitute of Software Integrated Systems; and the Institute for Space and Defense Electronics.\n \nIn all its engineering programs, Vanderbilt recognizes the vital place of experimental and research laboratories in\nthe learning experience. Laboratories are designed to provide the strongest personal contact between students and\nfaculty members consistent with enrollment.\nPage 171 of 1019\nWell-equipped undergraduate laboratories are maintained by the Chemistry and Physics & Astronomy departments\nin the College of Arts and Science, which offers mathematics and basic science courses required of all engineering\nstudents. Graduate and undergraduate divisions of these departments maintain teaching and research facilities in\nthe Stevenson Center for the Natural Sciences. Another supporting department, Biological Sciences, is housed in\nMedical Research Building III. Most classes in humanities and the social sciences are conducted in Buttrick, Calhoun,\nFurman, Garland, and Wilson halls.\n \nProfessional Registration and Accreditation\nLegislation exists in the various states requiring registration of all engineers who contract with the public to perform\nprofessional work. Although many engineering positions do not require professional certification, Vanderbilt\nsupports registration and encourages its graduates to take the Fundamentals of Engineering examination as soon as\nthey become eligible.\n \nBachelor of engineering degrees in biomedical engineering, chemical engineering, civil engineering, electrical and\ncomputer engineering, and mechanical engineering are accredited as noted below. Students in these programs may\ntake the Fundamentals of Engineering examination as seniors. In addition, proven professional experience is a\nrequirement for registration. Some state boards may have additional requirements for licensure.\n \nAll programs leading to the Bachelor of Engineering degree and the program leading to the Bachelor of Science in\ncomputer science are accredited as follows:\n \nThe Bachelor of Engineering degree program in biomedical engineering is accredited by the Engineering\nAccreditation Commission of ABET, https://www.abet.org/, under the General Criteria and the Program Criteria for\nBioengineering and Biomedical and Similarly Named Engineering Programs.\n \nThe Bachelor of Engineering degree program in civil engineering is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation\nCommission of ABET, https://www.abet.org/, under the General Criteria and the Program Criteria for Civil and\nSimilarly Named Engineering Programs.\n \nThe Bachelor of Engineering degree program in chemical engineering is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation\nCommission of ABET, https://www.abet.org/, under the General Criteria and the Program Criteria for Chemical,\nBiochemical, Biomolecular and Similarly Named Engineering Programs.\n \nThe Bachelor of Science program in computer science is accredited by the Computing Accreditation Commission of\nABET, https://www.abet.org/, under the General Criteria and Program Criteria for Computer Science and Similarly\nNamed Computing Programs. The accredited program in computer science is the primary major administered by the\nSchool of Engineering. Computer science added as a second major by students outside the School of Engineering is\nnot an accredited program.\n \nThe Bachelor of Engineering degree program in electrical and computer engineering is accredited by the\nEngineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, https://www.abet.org/, under the General Criteria and the Program\nCriteria for Electrical, Computer, Communications, Telecommunication(s) and Similarly Named Engineering\nPrograms.\n \nThe Bachelor of Engineering degree program in mechanical engineering is accredited by the the Engineering\nAccreditation Commission of ABET, https://www.abet.org/, under the General Criteria and the Program Criteria for\nPage 172 of 1019\nMechanical and Similarly Named Engineering Programs.\nEmployment of Graduates\nOf the recent Vanderbilt graduates with baccalaureate degrees in engineering, about 75 percent entered directly\ninto professional practice. Twenty-five percent continued with graduate or professional education. Others pursued\ndiverse careers or other interests. Additional information regarding the employment of engineering graduates is\navailable on the School of Engineering's website and in the VU Career Center.\nSupporting Organizations\nVanderbilt Engineering Council\nThe Engineering Council is a student organization whose main goal is facilitating community among undergraduate\nstudents in the School of Engineering by organizing activities, e.g., Engineering Week, de-stress events around final\nexaminations, and many more. Additionally, the council acts as a student voice to school administration and faculty.\nRepresentatives of engineering student organizations apply to serve on the E-Council leadership team, and the\ncurrent leadership board selects and trains the new members. While the council has no administrative power, it\nprovides students with a voice in the decision- making process in the School of Engineering.\nProfessional Societies\nThe leading national engineering societies have chartered branches or student sections at Vanderbilt. These\norganizations are run locally by students with the help of a faculty adviser. Meetings are devoted to matters of a\ntechnical nature, including outside speakers, plant trips, and other subjects of interest to the membership.\n \nStudents are invited to attend meetings and join as they will find the work of the professional societies beneficial in\norienting them in their careers.\n \nThe student professional societies are:\n \nAmerican Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics\n(A.I.A.A.)\nInstitute for Electrical and Electronics Engineers (I.E.E.E.)\nAmerican Institute of Chemical Engineers (AICh.E)\nNational Society of Black Engineers (N.S.B.E.)\nAmerican Society of Civil Engineers (A.S.C.E.)\nSociety of Asian Scientists and Engineers (S.A.S.E.)\nAmerican Society of Mechanical Engineers (A.S.M.E)\nSociety of Hispanic Professional Engineers (S.H.P.E.)\nBiomedical Engineering Society\nSociety of Automotive Engineers (S.A.E.)\nEngineering World Health (E.W.H.)\nSociety of Women Engineers (S.W.E.)\nEngineers Without Borders (E.W.B.)\nWomen in Computing\n \nThe student Honor Societies are:\nTau Beta Pi\nAlpha Eta Mu Beta\n \nGraduating seniors may join the Order of the Engineer, a society that recognizes the commitment of its members to\nthe profession of engineering.\n \nIn addition to student chapters of national professional societies, the School of Engineering also hosts a number of\nadditional student organizations.\nDegree Programs in Engineering\nPage 173 of 1019\nDegree Programs in Engineering\nUndergraduate Degrees\nThe First Year\nMathematics and Physics\nLiberal Arts Core\nImmersion\nOpen Electives\nOfficer Education\nMaster of Engineering\nDigital Learning Programs\n \n \nBachelor of engineering degree programs are offered in the areas of biomedical, chemical, civil, electrical and\ncomputer, environmental, and mechanical engineering. Many of these programs allow considerable flexibility\u2014but\nstudents are required to include in their courses of study those bodies of knowledge fundamental to that discipline.\n \nBachelor of science degree programs are offered in computer science and engineering science. The latter\ninterdisciplinary engineering discipline allows strong concentration in other areas of engineering or outside of the\nSchool of Engineering. \n \nThe school offers the master of engineering (M.Eng.), with emphasis on engineering design and practice, in most\nareas of study. The Graduate School, through departments of the School of Engineering, offers the research-oriented\nPh.D. and M.S. degrees in eight major fields. Degree programs offered by the School of Engineering are shown\nbelow.\nDegree Programs in Engineering\n \nB.E.\nB.S.\nM.Eng.\nM.S.\nPh.D.\nBiomedical Engineering\n\u2022\n \n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\nChemical Engineering\n\u2022\n \n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\nCivil Engineering\n\u2022\n \n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\nComputer Science\n \n\u2022\n \n\u2022\n\u2022\nCyber-Physical Systems\n \n \n\u2022\n \n \nElectrical and Computer Engineering\n\u2022\n \n \n\u2022\n\u2022\nEngineering in Surgery and Intervention\n \n \n\u2022\n \n \nEngineering Management\n \n \n\u2022\n \n \nEngineering Science\n \n\u2022\n \n \n \nEnvironmental Engineering\n\u2022\n \n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\nInterdisciplinary Materials Science\n \n \n \n\u2022\n\u2022\nMechanical Engineering\n\u2022\n \n\u2022\n\u2022\n\u2022\nRisk, Reliability, and Resilience Engineering\n \n \n\u2022\n \n \n \n \nPage 174 of 1019\nUndergraduate Degrees\nThe First Year\nMost courses normally scheduled for the first year are common to both the B.E. and B.S. degree programs. While the\ncurriculum for the first year is generally the same for all students, there are important variations. For example, some\nmajor programs require a full year of introductory chemistry; others do not. Students should become familiar with\nrequirements of those programs in which they have an interest and confer with their adviser at the time of\nenrollment and throughout the first year to plan a program of study that will keep options open as long as possible.\n \nSpecimen curricula for the engineering programs are given in the Courses of Study section. Requirements for the\nB.E. and B.S. degrees for the various programs vary in the minimum amount of hours and in specific course\nrequirements in the basic sciences and in mathematics.\n \nIncluded in the first year for all majors is the course Engineering Science 1401\u20131403 Introduction to Engineering,\nwhich introduces the student to design tools used in all areas of engineering.\nMathematics and Physics\nEntering engineering students will be placed in the appropriate level mathematics course. Students having one full\nyear or more of high school credit in analytic geometry and calculus may qualify for advanced placement in a\nregular sequence by scoring well on the Advanced Placement Examination.\n \nStudents with high mathematical ability and achievement as demonstrated by testing credit or credit by\nexamination through the Department of Mathematics may begin in the next mathematics course for which they\nqualify (e.g., MATH 1301 or 2300). For more information, see the testing credit information under Advanced Credit in\nthe Admissions section of this catalog and course descriptions under Mathematics in the Arts and Science section of\nthis catalog. For majors requiring Math 2420 (Methods of Ordinary Differential Equations), students may select Math\n2400 (Differential Equations with Linear Algebra) or Math 2610 (Ordinary Differential Equations) as a substitute.\n \nFirst-year students with a test score of 5 on the Calculus-BC Advanced Placement examination and who wish to\npursue the honors track of a second major in mathematics may take MATH 2500-2501, which will cover the material\nfrom MATH 2300 and 2600 but in a deeper and integrated fashion. Note that while linear algebra is required for\nsome VUSE majors, no VUSE major specifically requires 2600. Students considering this option must discuss this\nwith the Director of Undergraduate Studies in Mathematics and the School of Engineering Office of Academic\nServices.\n \nStudents with inadequate backgrounds in mathematics may be required to take Math 1005 (Pre-calculus\nMathematics). Taking this course constitutes an additional requirement for graduation.\n \nMath 1010-1011 (Probability and Statistical Inference) and Math 1100 (Survey of Calculus) cannot be credited\ntoward a degree in the School of Engineering.\n \nStudents with greater interest in physics may enroll in Phys 1911, 1912, 1912L, and 2255L (Principles of Physics I\nand II and labs) as substitutes for Phys 1601, 1602, 1601L, and 1602L (General Physics I and II and labs),\nrespectively. Students should consult with their Academic Adviser before taking this more advanced Physics\nsequence.\n \nPre-calculus courses Phys 1010, 1010L, 1020, 1020L, 2051, 2052, 2053, and 2054 cannot be credited toward a\ndegree in the School of Engineering.\nPage 175 of 1019\nLiberal Arts Core\nIn order to provide the elements of a general education considered necessary for responsible practice as an\neducated engineer, the School of Engineering requires each student to complete at least 18 hours in the Liberal Arts\nCore comprising:\n1. At least 3 hours selected from courses classified in the AXLE Curriculum Course Distribution as Humanities\nand Creative Arts (HCA), with the exception of CMST 1500, 2100, 2110, and 2120, and\n2.

To fulfill the university requirement of Immersion Vanderbilt, a\nstudent must participate in immersive experiences and then complete a culminating project that is based on one\nspecific immersive experience as described in the Special Programs for Undergraduates section near the start of this\ncatalog.\nThe experiential learning may focus on one or more areas of student interest. Most engineering students will take\nadvantage of a four-year engineering design experience to satisfy the requirements of Immersion Vanderbilt. Each\nengineering major offers such a multi-year experience within its curriculum. Students whose plans include\nprofessional development may also pursue industrial internships. A research path can engage the student in\ndiscovery through research in engineering or other fields. While most engineering students will select an immersion\nexperience associated with their major, students can pursue an Immersion plan outside their home program. For\nexample, students interested in creative expression might develop a performance piece, exhibit, or artistic work,\nwhile those interested in international study may explore firsthand the culture, language, and history of other\ncountries. Students interested in such immersion plans should consult the Office of Experiential Learning and\nImmersion (EL&IV).\n \nThe Immersion Vanderbilt process is composed of several phases. Senior design projects in the School of\nEngineering satisfy the final project requirement for Immersion Vanderbilt, with students presenting the results of\ntheir design project at the school's Design Day or Computer Science Immersion Showcase. For students completing\nother immersion projects, the Office of Experiential Learning and Immersion Vanderbilt coordinates a series of\nshowcases open to the entire campus where students display their projects. Upon completion of the project, Office\nof Experiential Learning and Immersion Vanderbilt conveys that the requirements have been met by showing\ncompletion of the Immersion Vanderbilt graduation requirement on the student's degree audit.\nOpen Electives\nCourses taken beyond specified courses and restricted (such as program, technical, and liberal arts) electives for the\nmajor may be taken as open electives.\nOfficer Education\nCourse offerings in military science and naval science are described in the section on Special Programs for\nPage 176 of 1019\nUndergraduates near the beginning of the catalog. All officer education courses designated as eligible for credit may\nbe taken as open electives. In addition, some officer education courses in history and political science may be taken\nas part of the Liberal Arts Core while some officer education courses in engineering science may be taken as\ntechnical electives. AFROTC students may count 6 hours of the military courses as open electives.\nMaster of Engineering\nThe master of engineering (M.Eng.) is an advanced professional degree awarded by the School of Engineering and\nespecially designed for engineering practitioners who may prefer to work while doing professional study. It is also\nsuitable for individuals who apply directly from undergraduate school\u2014but the thrust of the program is toward\nprofessional practice in engineering rather than research or teaching. The degree is offered in biomedical\nengineering, chemical engineering, civil engineering, cyber-physical systems, engineering in surgery and\nintervention, engineering management, environmental engineering, mechanical engineering, and risk, reliability,\nand resilience engineering.\n \nStudents must complete 30 hours of approved course work. A maximum of 6 hours of graduate-level course work\nmay be transferred from another institution, and a maximum period of seven years is allowed to complete the\ndegree. An extensive, written design report shall be submitted on a project approved by the student\u2019s project\nadviser.\n \nRegular admission to the Master of Engineering program normally requires graduation from an approved\nundergraduate program in engineering or a related scientific discipline, attainment of a B average in undergraduate\ncourses applicable to the student\u2019s career goals, and recommendations containing favorable appraisals of\nprofessional promise and attitude. A period of successful work experience prior to application to the program will\nalso be given consideration. For information about admissions, application procedures, and application deadlines for\nthe Master of Engineering programs, please visit https://engineering.vanderbilt.edu/academics/master-of-\nengineering-degree.\n \nCurrent undergraduates in the School of Engineering may be eligible to earn the Master of Engineering via the\nIntegrated Bachelor and Master of Engineering program described in the next section of this catalog.\n \nFor international students who did not graduate from an institution in a country where English is the official\nlanguage, proficiency in English must be shown by a minimum score of 89 on the TOEFL or 7 on the IELTS test.\nDigital Learning Programs\nThe School of Engineering offers two degree programs online: an M.S. in Computer Science, and an M.Eng. in\nEngineering Management. Courses in these digital learning programs are only available to students enrolled in\nthese online degree programs. For information about admissions, application procedures, and application deadlines\nfor the School of Engineering Digital Learning programs, please visit the website engineeringonline.vanderbilt.edu.\nSpecial Programs in the School of Engineering\nHonors Programs\nStudy Abroad\nTeacher Education\nSecond Major\nMinors\nFocus Areas\nDual Degree Program with Fisk University\nPage 177 of 1019\nIntegrated Bachelor and Master of Engineering\nAccelerated Graduate Program in Engineering\n \nHonors Programs\nHonors programs allow selected undergraduate students to develop individually through independent study and\nresearch. Honors programs of each major are described in the Courses of Study section.\n \nRequirements vary somewhat but, in general, to qualify for consideration a student should have (a) completed the\ntechnical course requirements of the first two years, (b) attained a minimum grade average of 3.5 in all work taken\nfor credit, and (c) shown evidence indicating a capacity for independent study and/or research. Formal admission is\nby election of the department concerned. Once admitted, candidates remain in the program only if they maintain a\n3.5 or higher grade point average.\n \nAccepted candidates normally begin honors study in the junior year, but exceptions may be made for outstanding\nseniors.\n \nSuccessful candidates are awarded Honors in their major. This designation appears on their diplomas.\nStudy Abroad\nVanderbilt's Global Education Office offers approximately thirty programs that allow students to take engineering or\ncomputer science courses in English abroad, in locations ranging from Dublin to Sydney, Madrid to Hong Kong.\nThere are no language prerequisites for these programs. These programs also allow students to take a range of\nliberal arts core, major core, and elective courses abroad. In no case, after matriculating at Vanderbilt, may a\nstudent participate in a Vanderbilt-approved study abroad program through a different university or through an\nexternal agency and then seek to transfer that credit into Vanderbilt. Financial aid can be used for study abroad\nduring the academic year, and scholarships are available to support Vanderbilt-approved summer study abroad\noptions. Students are encouraged to discuss with their academic advisers how best to incorporate study abroad into\ntheir four-year plans of study. All students who study abroad must register their travel in advance with Vanderbilt\u2019s\ninternational security provider.\n \nRegistration is completed on your behalf when enrolling in a program offered through the Global Education Office.\nOtherwise, information is available on the GlobalVU website: vanderbilt.edu/global.\nTeacher Education\nStudents who are interested in preparing for licensure as secondary school teachers should plan their programs in\nconsultation with the associate dean in the School of Engineering and the Director of Secondary Education in the\nDepartment of Teaching and Learning at Peabody College. More specific information on professional education\ncourse requirements can be found under the Licensure for Teaching chapter in the Peabody College section of this\ncatalog. Inquiries can also be made to the Office of Teacher Licensure at Peabody.\nSecond Major\nIt is possible for a student to combine an engineering field with a second area outside the School of Engineering.\nThe student must obtain prior approval of each department and satisfy the requirements of each major, including\nthe requirement regarding minimum grade point average. Students in the School of Engineering may use courses\noutside the School of Engineering for relevant second majors even if those courses also fulfill a degree requirement.\n \nCertain double majors involving two programs within the School of Engineering have been approved by the faculty.\nThe approved double majors are biomedical engineering/electrical and computer engineering, and biomedical\nengineering/chemical engineering.\nPage 178 of 1019\nBoth majors are indicated on the student\u2019s transcript. Only one degree is awarded, from the school in which the\nstudent is enrolled.\nMinors\nA minor consists of at least five courses of at least 3 credit hours each within a recognized area of knowledge. A\nminor offers students more than a casual introduction to an area, but less than a major. A minor is not a degree\nrequirement, but students may elect to complete one or more. Courses may not be taken on a Pass/Fail basis. A\nminor for which all designated courses are completed with a grade point average of at least 2.000 will be entered on\nthe transcript at the time of graduation.\n \nWhen a minor is offered in a discipline that offers a major, only those courses that count toward the major may be\ncounted toward the minor. Students should refer to the appropriate sections of this catalog for specific\nrequirements. Minors are offered in engineering management, materials science and engineering, computer\nscience, data science, digital fabrication, electrical and computer engineering, energy and environmental systems,\nenvironmental engi\u200bneering, nanoscience and nanotechnology, quantum information science and engineering,\nscientific computing, and most disciplines of the College of Arts and Science, Blair School of Music, and Peabody\nCollege.\n \nStudents declare their intention to pursue a minor by completing the online Major/Minor Declaration/Change\nworkflow process found here: https://registrar.vanderbilt.edu/registration/forms.php. Departments and programs\nusually assign advisers to students who declare minors in their areas. Students are responsible for knowing and\nsatisfying all requirements for the minors they intend to complete.\nFocus Areas\nFocus areas provide guidance to students wishing to concentrate on a specialized topic within engineering. Focus\nareas are typically nine credit hours, and qualifying courses are listed in the catalog. Students can declare a\nmaximum of three focus areas; however, a qualifying course cannot be applied to more than one focus area.\nStudents interested in declaring a focus area must do so before the start of their final semester at Vanderbilt.\nSuccessful completion of a declared focus area will be designated on a student's transcript upon graduation.\nThe School of Engineering offers the following focus areas:\nHuman Computer Interaction\nMicroelectronics\nNanotechnology\nStrategic and Technical Consulting\nEngineering Communications\nTechnology Entrepreneurship\nProduct Development\nDual Degree Program with Fisk University\nA coordinated dual degree program between the Vanderbilt University School of Engineering and Fisk University is\nespecially designed to permit students to obtain an A.B. degree in biology, chemistry, computer science, physics, or\nmathematics from Fisk and a B.E. degree in engineering from Vanderbilt, generally within five years.\n \nFor the first three years, the student is enrolled at Fisk in a science or mathematics curriculum and, by cross-\nregistration in the second and third years, takes introductory engineering courses at Vanderbilt. During the fourth\nand fifth years, the student is enrolled at Vanderbilt, following principally an engineering curriculum at Vanderbilt\nand completing necessary courses at Fisk. At the end of five years, the student should be able to satisfy the\nrequirements for both bachelor\u2019s degrees.\n \nFinancial aid is available for qualified, deserving students. Additional information is available from the director of\nPage 179 of 1019\ntransfer admissions in the Office of Undergraduate Admissions.\nIntegrated Bachelor and Master of Engineering\nOn the basis of recommendations containing favorable appraisals of professional promise, undergraduate students\nin the School of Engineering who have completed at least 75 hours by the end of the second year with at least a\n3.500 grade point average may be accepted into an integrated Bachelor of Engineering\u2013Master of Engineering\nprogram. This program is currently available in chemical, civil, environmental, or mechanical engineering. This\nprogram can also be completed with the Master of Engineering degree in Engineering in Surgery and Intervention\n(ESI) in combination with the bachelor's degree in biomedical, mechanical, electrical and computer engineering, or\nengineering science. The last two years of a student\u2019s program are planned as a unit.\n \nWith the approval of the student\u2019s adviser, the director of graduate studies in the student\u2019s major department, and\nthe senior associate dean for undergraduate education, students apply through the senior associate dean for\ngraduate education for admission to this integrated dual degree program. Upon admission to this program, a\nsecond \u201ccareer\u201d will be set up for the student which will allow the student to start taking graduate courses (course\nnumbers > 5000) during the junior and senior years. These courses will be credited toward the master of\nengineering.\n \nNote that no double counting of courses is allowed (i.e., the student must meet the degree requirements for each\ndegree independent of the other degree). No more than 18 total credit hours between the two careers can be taken\nin a single semester. The student typically receives the bachelor\u2019s degree at the end of the fourth year and\ncompletes the master of engineering during the fifth year. Further information can be obtained from the director of\ngraduate studies of the student\u2019s major department.\nAccelerated Graduate Program in Engineering\nStudents who enter Vanderbilt with a significant number of credits, earned either through Advanced Placement or\nInternational Baccalaureate tests or in college courses taken during high school, may be eligible for the Accelerated\nGraduate Program in Engineering. Through this program, a student is able to earn both a bachelor\u2019s degree and a\nmaster of science in about the same time required for the bachelor\u2019s degree or slightly longer. To be eligible for the\nprogram, a student must complete 86 hours (senior standing) by the end of the sophomore year with at least a\n3.500 grade point average. With the approval of the student\u2019s adviser, the director of graduate studies in the\nstudent\u2019s major department, and the senior associate dean for undergraduate education, students apply through the\nsenior associate dean for graduate education for admission to this accelerated dual degree program. Upon\nadmission to this program, a second \u201ccareer\u201d will be set up for the student which will allow the student to start\ntaking graduate courses (course numbers > 5000) during the junior and senior years. These courses will be credited\ntoward the master of science.\n \nNote that no double counting of courses is allowed (i.e., the student must meet the degree requirements for each\ndegree independent of the other degree). No more than 18 total credit hours between the two careers can be taken\nin a single semester. The student receives the bachelor\u2019s degree at the end of the fourth year and typically spends\nthe summer finishing a master\u2019s thesis to complete the master of science. Further information can be obtained from\nthe director of graduate studies of the student\u2019s major department.\nHonors in the School of Engineering\nFounder's Medal\nLatin Honors Designation\nDean's List\nHonor Societies\nOther Awards and Prizes\nFounder\u2019s Medal\nPage 180 of 1019\nThe Founder\u2019s Medal, signifying first honors, was endowed by Commodore Cornelius Vanderbilt as one of his gifts to\nthe university.

Lewis, Marlon Thomas\n \nCOURSES OFFERED: BME\n \nThe foundations of biomedical engineering are the same as those in other engineering disciplines: mathematics,\nphysics, chemistry, and engineering principles. Biomedical engineering builds on these foundations to solve\nproblems in biology  and medicine over the widest range of scales-from the nanoscale and molecular levels to the\nwhole body. Biomedical engineering provides a robust platform for employment in the medical device and\ninstrumentation industries as well as careers in companies that specialize in the development and application of\nbiologics, biomaterials, computation, implants and processes. Our graduates gain entry into nationally recognized\ngraduate schools for continuing studies in biomedical engineering.\n \nBiomedical engineering is also a rigorous path for admission to and success in medical school for those students\nPage 185 of 1019\nwilling and able to excel in mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, physiology, and engineering.\n \nThe Department of Biomedical Engineering at Vanderbilt is unique among biomedical engineering programs in its\nimmediate proximity to the world class Vanderbilt Medical Center, located on our compact campus. Our School of\nMedicine is among the top ten in funding from the National Institutes of Health and includes a National Cancer\nInstitute- recognized Comprehensive Cancer Center, a major children\u2019s hospital and a Level I trauma center. This\nproximity and the strong relationships among faculty across multiple schools stimulate high impact research and\nprovide unique educational and research opportunities for students.\n \nDegree Programs. The Department of Biomedical Engineering offers courses of study leading to the B.E., M.S.,\nM.Eng., and Ph.D. Vanderbilt biomedical engineering is a well-established program with undergraduate degrees\ngranted continuously since 1965. Our undergraduate curriculum undergoes regular review and revision to ensure\nrelevancy and to maintain full ABET accreditation. Students have complete flexibility in the selection of biomedical\nengineering, technical, and open electives. This allows students to design their own focus areas such as\nregenerative medicine and tissue engineering, wearables and point-of-care diagnostics, global health, surgery and\nengineering, robotics and prosthetics, lasers and medicine, medical imaging, biotechnology and nanomedicine,\nmedical technology and entrepreneurship.\n \nFacilities. The Department of Biomedical Engineering is located in Stevenson Center. Undergraduate instructional\nlaboratories are equipped for study of biomedical processes, measurement methods and instrumentation. These\nfacilities are equipped with embedded systems for instrumentation, design, and testing that mirror professional\npractice. Specialized facilities for biomedical imaging, biophotonics, cell and tissue culture, microfabrication, surgery\nand intervention, and nanoengineering are used both for faculty-led research and instructional purposes.\n \nUndergraduate Honors Program. With approval of the Honors Program director, junior and senior students in\nbiomedical engineering who have achieved a minimum grade point average of 3.5 may be accepted into the\nundergraduate Honors Program. Students in the program take at least 6 credit hours of 5000-level or above\n(graduate) biomedical engineering courses, which can be counted toward the 127-hour undergraduate degree\nrequirements as biomedical engineering electives or which can be taken for graduate school credit. Students in the\nHonors Program must also complete a two-semester-long research project and present a research report; this is\ngenerally accomplished through the BME 3860 and 3861 Undergraduate Research elective courses. Honors students\nmust make a grade point average of 3.0 in these classes and maintain an overall 3.5 GPA to be designated as an\nhonors graduate. The diploma designation is Honors in Biomedical Engineering.\n \nCurriculum Requirements\nThe B.E. in biomedical engineering requires a minimum of 127 hours, distributed as follows:\n1. Mathematics (15 hours): MATH 1300, 1301, 2300, 2400.\n2. Basic Science (20 hours): CHEM 1601, 1601L, 1602, 1602L; PHYS 1601, 1601L, 1602, 1602L; BSCI 1510,\n1510L. \n3.

Beyer\n \nCOURSES OFFERED: CHBE\n \nChemical engineers play key roles in the development and production of commodity chemicals, pharmaceuticals,\nand bioengineered materials, high strength composites and specialty polymers, semiconductors and microelectronic\ndevices, and a wide range of ultrapure fine chemicals. Indeed, chemical engineering is essential for the operation of\ncontemporary society. The solutions to many of the problems that we face today\u2014e.g., energy, the environment,\nPage 189 of 1019\ndevelopment of high-performance materials\u2014will involve chemical engineers.\n \nThe undergraduate program in chemical engineering prepares students to contribute to the solution of these and\nsimilar problems. Graduates find meaningful careers in industry, in government laboratories, and as consultants.\nSome continue their education through graduate studies in chemical engineering, business, law, or medicine.\n \nMission. The mission of the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering is to educate those who will\nadvance the knowledge base in chemical engineering, become practicing chemical engineers, and be leaders in the\nchemical and process industries, academia, and government; to conduct both basic and applied research in\nchemical engineering and related interdisciplinary areas; and to provide service to the chemical engineering\nprofession, the School of Engineering, Vanderbilt University, the country, and the world.\n \nDegree Programs. The Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering offers the B.E. in chemical\nengineering and graduate study leading to the M.Eng., M.S., and Ph.D.\n \nUndergraduate chemical engineering students acquire a solid background in mathematics, chemistry, biology,\nphysics, and computing. The chemical and biomolecular engineering program has as its basis courses in transport\nphenomena, thermodynamics, separations, and kinetics. Other courses deal with the principles and techniques of\nchemical engineering analysis and design, along with economic analysis, process control, chemical process safety,\nbioprocessing, process simulation, and engineering ethics. Laboratory courses offer the student an opportunity to\nmake fundamental measurements of momentum, heat, and mass transport and to gain hands-on experience with\nbench scale and small scale pilot-plant equipment, which can be computer controlled. Effective report writing and\ntechnical communication are principal skills gained in the laboratory and design courses. Many students carry out\nindividual research projects.\n \nA specimen curriculum for a chemical engineering major follows. This standard program includes electives that\nstudents, in consultation with their faculty advisers, select to pursue breadth or a minor or focus area with their\nchemical engineering major. Specimen curricula with emphases in specific areas are available on the department\nwebsite. Double majors may be arranged in consultation with a faculty adviser.\n \nStudents are recommended to take the Fundamentals of Engineering Examination (FE) in their senior year. This is\nthe first step in obtaining a license as a professional engineer. The following courses are recommended for\npreparation for the FE: ECE 2112, CE 2200, and ME 2190.\n \nUndergraduate Honors Program. The Honors Program in chemical engineering provides an opportunity for selected\nstudents to develop individually through independent study and research. General requirements are described in\nthe Special Programs chapter. The chemical and biomolecular engineering department requires a minimum overall\nGPA of 3.5. Acceptance to the program is made by petition to the faculty during the junior year. Transfer students\nmay be considered for admission after completing one semester at Vanderbilt. Candidates for honors choose their\ntechnical courses with the consent of a faculty honors adviser. Requirements include at least 6 hours of CHBE\ncourses numbered 5000 or above, plus 6 hours of CHBE 3860 and 3861 taken in the junior and/or senior year under\nthe direction of a faculty honors adviser. A formal written research report is submitted each semester CHBE 3860 or\n3861 is taken with a final report and presentation given in the spring semester of the senior year to the CHBE\nfaculty and students. The diploma designation is Honors in Chemical Engineering.\n \nFacilities. The Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering department is located in Olin Hall. Undergraduate\ninstructional laboratories are equipped for study of transport phenomena, unit operations, kinetics, and process\ncontrol.

This goal\nrequires going beyond technical competence in a balanced education to develop future leaders in the fields of\nconsulting, industry, business, law, government, and research.\n \nB.E. in civil engineering. Civil engineers must be able to face complex problems of modern society involving the\ndevelopment of physical facilities that serve the public while protecting the environment and preserving social\nvalues. Challenges facing civil and environmental engineers concern housing, urban transportation, pollution\ncontrol, water resources development, industrial development, maintaining and advancing our nation\u2019s aging\ninfrastructure, and exploring space. Addressing these challenges with today\u2019s limited resources requires innovative\nand original ideas from highly-skilled engineers.\n \nUndergraduates majoring in civil engineering receive a strong background in mathematics, science, engineering\nscience, and engineering design. The program also includes courses in economics, humanities, social sciences,\nresources management, and public policy. Students participate in design teams and laboratory studies as well as\nclassroom activities. Use of various computer-based methods is integral to problem solving and design.\n \nVanderbilt\u2019s B.E. in civil engineering prepares students for entry-level positions in many specialty areas of civil\nengineering, as well as many other types of careers, such as business, construction, and law. Today, however, and\neven more so in the future, professional practice at a high level will require an advanced degree. We recommend\nthat students seriously consider pursuing the M.S. or M. Eng. soon after obtaining the B.E.\n \nB.E./M.Eng. Five Year Program. Students seeking advanced study in civil and environmental engineering may be\nPage 194 of 1019\ninterested in the combined B.E./M.Eng., enabling students to complete the B.E. in civil engineering and M.Eng. in\ncivil engineering or environmental engineering in five years.\n \nConstruction Management Five Year Program. Students seeking advanced study in construction management may\nbe interested in the combined B.E./M.Eng., enabling students to complete the B.E. in civil engineering and M.Eng. in\ncivil engineering (construction management emphasis) in five years.\n \nUndergraduate Honors Program. Recognized with the diploma designation Honors in Civil Engineering, exceptional\nstudents may be invited in their junior year to participate in the civil engineering Honors Program. Designed as a\nunique individualized educational experience, participants work closely with departmental faculty members to tailor\na selection of courses that actively immerses them in a selected field of study. Experiences include enrollment in a 3\nsemester hour independent study course and participation in a summer research internship. Honors Program\nparticipants are especially well-prepared to enter graduate study, and they may count the independent study course\ntowards their civil engineering technical electives.\n \nFacilities. The civil engineering laboratory provides for static and dynamic testing of materials and structural\ncomponents and assemblies. Testing facilities include capabilities of testing composites, metals, and concrete under\nstatic loads, fatigue, base acceleration (to simulate seismic events) and intermediate to high speed impacts (to\nsimulate responses to blast events). Full soils testing facilities are available. Hydraulics facilities include several\nmodel flow systems to illustrate principles of fluid mechanics and hydrology. The transportation laboratory is\ncomputer-based, with emphasis on transportation systems and design, intelligent transportation systems, and\ngeographic information systems. The environmental laboratories are fully supplied with modern instrumentation for\nchemical, physical, biological, and radiological analysis of soils, sediments, water, wastewater, air, and solid waste.\nThey include equipment for the study of biological waste treatment, physical-chemical waste treatment,\ncontainment mass transfer, and state-of-the-art instrumentation. All are available for student use in courses,\ndemonstrations, and research.\nCurriculum Requirements\nThe B.E. in civil engineering requires a minimum of 125 hours, distributed as follows:\n1.

The program provides a strong engineering background centered on digital\ntechnology combined with an understanding of the principles and techniques of computer science. Computer\nengineering is design-oriented. The basic principles of engineering and computer science are applied to the task at\nhand, which may be the design of a digital processor, processor peripheral, or a complete digital processor-based\nsystem.\n \nPage 198 of 1019\nWhatever the undertaking, the comprehensive academic training in this program enables engineers to evaluate the\nimpact of their decisions, whether working with hardware, software, or the interface between the two.\n \nThe computer engineering program combines fundamental core requirements with flexibility to allow students to\nspecialize in a variety of emphasis areas within the program. The curriculum includes requirements in the basic\nsciences, mathematics, and humanities; a primary core of hardware and software courses; and a set of electives\nthat combine breadth and depth requirements as described below. Students who major in computer engineering\nwho wish to apply for graduate study in electrical engineering or computer science are encouraged strongly to\nselect their elective courses to demonstrate depth in that particular area; the structure of the program enables that\noption. The course of study leads to a bachelor of engineering.\n \nUndergraduate Honors Program. With faculty approval, junior and senior students may be accepted into the Honors\nProgram. To achieve honors status, the student must:\n1. achieve and maintain a minimum GPA of 3.5.\n2. complete 3 hours of undergraduate research (ECE 3860, 3861 or CS 3860, 3861) with final written report\n3. complete 6 hours of ECE program elective credit from the following list:\na. up to 3 additional hours of undergraduate research (ECE 3860, 3861 or CS 3860, 3861), or\nb. design domain expertise (DE) courses beyond the one course required by the program, or\nc. CS 3259, CS 3892, CS 4287, or\nd. 5000-level courses.\nThe diploma designation is Honors in Computer Engineering.\n \nFacilities. Electrical and computer engineering supports undergraduate laboratories emphasizing the principal areas\nof the disciplines: analog and digital electronics, microcomputers, microprocessors, microelectronics, and\ninstrumentation. In addition, several specialized facilities are available for graduate research: the advanced carbon\nnanotechnology and diamond labs, the Institute for Software Integrated Systems, the Institute for Space and\nDefense Electronics, the Medical Image Processing Laboratory, the Center for Intelligent Systems and Robotics\nLaboratories, the Embedded Computer Systems Laboratory, and biomedical, biosensing, and photonics laboratories.\n \nThe work in electrical and computer engineering is supported by a variety of computers and networks, including the\nhigh-performance computing facilities of the Advanced Computing Center for Research and Education. Vanderbilt is\none of the founding partners in the Internet II initiative.\n \nStudents interested in the major or minor in Computer Engineering are encouraged to consider instead\nthose in Electrical and Computer Engineering.\n \nThe major or minor in Computer Engineering may no longer be declared.

Caleb Clanton\n \nThe Division of Engineering Science and Management administers the engineering science major, the engineering\nmanagement minor, and the first-year introduction to engineering course. The division oversees non-traditional\nengineering study and advises students on course selection to meet specific career goals that traditional\nengineering majors may not provide.\n \nCOURSES OFFERED: ENGM, ES\nEngineering Science Major (Bachelor of Science)\nThe engineering science major is flexible and interdisciplinary\u2014offering students the opportunity to select a program\nof study to meet special interests or objectives. Many students choose a program of study in engineering\nmanagement, communication of science and technology, various engineering concentrations, environmental\nscience or materials  science; however, students may develop unique plans of study to specialize in areas for which\nfacilities and faculty competence exist but which are not covered within a single existing degree program at\nVanderbilt. Engineering science graduates may establish careers in engineering or science, interface with engineers\n(e.g., in marketing and sales), or use their analytical and problem-solving skills to build future professional careers.\nDefined areas of concentration exist in engineering management, communication of science and technology,\nsecondary education, and materials science and engineering. Individual programs have been developed for students\ninterested in careers in engineering mathematics, environmental engineering, transportation engineering, teaching,\ntechnical communications, and other areas requiring nontraditional combinations of engineering courses. Because\nof the flexible nature of the engineering science programs of study, accreditation has not been sought for these\nprograms of study, and engineering science majors will not qualify for engineering licensure in most states.\n \nEngineering Management. Engineering management is an interdisciplinary program of study designed to give\nstudents the tools to manage technology development and innovation, to enhance manufacturing quality and\nproductivity in a competitive international environment, and to implement these objectives successfully in an\nPage 212 of 1019\norganization. Engineering management links engineering, science, and the management disciplines. In addition to\nthe core science and math courses required of all engineering students, topics of study include entrepreneurship,\nhuman resources management, finance in technology-based organizations, technology strategy, communications,\nand operations.\n \nCommunication of Science and Technology. Many careers that are attractive to graduates of the engineering science\nprogram require the communication of engineering and science to people who are not technically trained. The\nCommunication of Science and Technology interdisciplinary program prepares engineering students for careers in\nareas such as technical consulting, high-technology marketing and sales, environmental law, and journalism. The\nprogram combines traditional engineering and science courses with communications and humanities courses in a\nflexible curriculum. Engineering science majors may select from a set of program electives identified by the faculty\ncommittee of the School of Engineering and the College of Arts and Science that supervises the program.\n \nMinors. Students may also pursue a minor consisting of at least five courses of at least three credit hours within a\nrecognized area of knowledge. Minors are offered in engineering management, materials science and engineering,\ncomputer engineering, electrical engineering, computer science, scientific computing, environmental engineering,\nenergy and environmental systems, nanoscience and nanotechnology, and most disciplines within the College of\nArts and Science. Students must declare their intention to pursue minors by completing forms available in the Office\nof Academic Services of the School of Engineering.\nCurriculum Requirements\nThe B.S. in engineering science requires a minimum of 122 hours, distributed as follows:\n1. Basic Science (16 hours).

Senior Capstone (5 hours): ES 4950, 4951, 4959.\n4. Liberal Arts Core (18 hours). To be selected to fulfill the Liberal Arts Core requirements listed in the Degree\nPrograms in Engineering.\n5. Open Electives (6 hours).\n6. Program Concentration (24 hours). In consultation with the academic adviser, each student must identify a\nmeaningful sequence of courses, not counting certain introductory-level courses, that directly contributes to\nmeeting stated career goals. Program concentrations are approved by the academic adviser and the program\ndirector in advance and become part of the student\u2019s degree audit.\nThe preparation provided by the program concentration, together with a solid foundation in basic engineering\ncourses, provides the engineering science student a strong and useful career base.\n \nNo more than 24 credit hours of business-related course work (BUS, BUSA, ENGM, FNEC, MGRL) may be applied to\nthe ES degree program. Only one business-related minor (BUS, ENGM, FNEC, MGRL, HOD) may count to a student\u2019s\nacademic program. No more than 6 credit hours of courses numbered 3840 to 3879 in any program may be applied\nto the ES degree program.\n \nUndergraduates in engineering science may apply the pass/ fail option only to courses taken as liberal arts core or\nopen electives, subject to the school requirements for pass/fail. UNIV courses are eligible for open elective credit\nonly. Credit for the senior capstone sequence (4 hours) satisfies the Immersion Vanderbilt requirement.\nPage 213 of 1019\nEnvironmental Engineering\nCurriculum Requirements\nSpecimen Curriculum for Environmental Engineering\n \n \nCHAIR Caglar Oskay\nASSOCIATE CHAIR Hiba Baroud\nDIRECTORS OF GRADUATE STUDIES Daniel B.

The curriculum includes analysis and design courses in environmental\nengineering. Vanderbilt\u2019s B.E. in environmental engineering prepares students for entry-level positions in many\nspecialty areas of environmental engineering, as well as a variety of other careers, such as business, government,\nand law. The major will provide students with the tools necessary to develop effective solutions to solve emerging\nand existing issues such as water resources, quality, and treatment; aging infrastructures; climate change and\ncarbon neutral innovations; energy and material resources; wastes and pollution; and other environmental\nchallenges. Recognizing that environmental solutions cannot be realized without consideration of social, cultural,\neconomic, and political factors, students will be required to extend the breadth of their studies with courses in data\nscience and global perspectives courses in social sciences, economics, political sciences, and the humanities.  These\nwill be in addition to foundational courses in the basic and applied sciences, mathematics, engineering, and\nadvanced courses in fate, transport, and treatment of contaminants in the environment. The curriculum culminates\nwith a senior design project in which students will have the opportunity to draw on and integrate the broad\nknowledge they have gained from the data science and global perspectives courses with the science and\nengineering knowledge they gained in the major. Due to the complex interdisciplinary nature of the field, many\nundergraduate students continue their environmental engineering education and earn either a professional (MEng)\ndegree or a graduate (MS or PhD) degree. \nPage 214 of 1019\nUndergraduate Honors Program. The Honors Program in environmental engineering provides an opportunity for\nselected students to develop individually through independent study and research. The environmental engineering\nhonors program requires a minimum overall GPA of 3.5. Acceptance to the program is made by petition to the\nfaculty during the junior year. Transfer students may be considered for admission after completing one semester at\nVanderbilt. Candidates for honors choose their technical courses with the consent of a faculty honors adviser. A\nthree-credit hour independent study course and a summer research internship with a final report and presentation\ngiven in the spring semester of the senior year to the ENVE faculty and students are required. The independent\nstudy course may also be counted towards the environmental engineering technical electives. The diploma\ndesignation is Honors in Environmental Engineering.\n \nFacilities: The environmental laboratories are fully supplied with modern instrumentation for chemical, physical,\nbiological, and radiological analysis of soils, sediments, water, wastewater, air, and solid waste.

Florian (Chemical\nand Biomolecular Engineering)\n \nCOURSES OFFERED: DF\n \nIndustry 4.0, or the fourth industrial revolution, is rapidly changing how companies manage their supply chains and\nmanufacture their products. New digital and physical technologies, including advanced materials, additive\nPage 224 of 1019\nmanufacturing, and software packages that employ machine learning to optimize both the geometry and function of\nparts and processes, have reached a level performance that enables their widespread integration throughout\nmanufacturing operations. Digital fabrication is the process of converting ideas to physical products through\ncomputer-driven design and manufacturing. Every aspect of the design process can be simulated, from materials\nselection to the toolpaths used to manipulate those materials. Consequently, digital fabrication technologies more\nefficient manufacturing of prototypes and commercial parts. This minor is intended for students who are interested\nin 3D printing, computer aided design (CAD), and product development.\n \nThe minor in Digital Fabrication prepares students for this area by providing both classroom and hands-on\ninstruction in advanced technologies used to prototype physical devices through computer-controlled design and\nmanufacturing. Students will learn how to scale-up production of their prototypes through both traditional and\nadditive-based manufacturing techniques. Students will gain experience through foundational courses for the minor\nand expand their application through electives often related to their major. The Vanderbilt makerspace ecosystem\nprovides students in the minor with hands-on experiences that allow them to design, construct, and iterate\nprototype devices using in-house state-of-the-art equipment.

Many of the barriers to widespread\nincorporation of alternate and renewable energy, from higher-capacity, more robust, less expensive batteries for\nenergy storage, to high efficiency/low cost solar devices, involve the need for new materials. Materials will play an\never-increasing role in health care. New medical devices, drug delivery systems, and synthetic biological tissue are\njust a few of the health-related applications in need of new materials for their success. In addition, materials\nchallenges are front and center in the ever-evolving areas of electronic devices. Engineers and scientists with\nknowledge of materials science and engineering concepts are needed to address these and many more materials\nchallenges.\n \nMaterials science and engineering is an interdisciplinary program with affiliated faculty from all engineering\ndisciplines, as well as faculty from chemistry, and physics. Two undergraduate options involving materials science\nand engineering are available.

The minor is administered by the School of Engineering.\n \nNanoscience and nanotechnology are based on the ability to synthesize, organize, characterize, and manipulate\nmatter systematically at dimensions of ~1 to 100 nm, creating uniquely functional materials that differ in properties\nfrom those prepared by traditional approaches. At these length scales, materials can take on new properties that\ncan be exploited in a wide range of applications such as for solar energy conversion, ultra-sensitive sensing, and\nnew types of vaccines. These activities require the integration of expertise from various areas of science and\nengineering, often relying on methods of synthesis, fabrication, and characterization that are beyond those\nencountered in an individual course of study.\n \nStudents who minor in nanoscience and nanotechnology learn the principles and methods used in this rapidly\ngrowing field. Its core originates in the physical sciences by providing key approaches for describing the behavior of\nmatter on the nanoscale. Synthetic approaches are used to manipulate matter systematically, for creating uniquely\nfunctional nanomaterials that can be inorganic, organic, biological, or a hybrid of these. With a third component of\ncharacterization, a process for designing systems to have particular properties as a result of their composition and\nnanoscale arrangement emerges. Students are introduced to these areas through foundational and elective courses\nfor the minor that are specified below, the latter of which can be selected to fulfill the degree requirements for their\nmajor.\n \nThe minor in nanoscience and nanotechnology is supported by the Vanderbilt Institute of Nanoscale Science and\nEngineering (VINSE) that brings together faculty from the College of Arts and Science, the School of Engineering,\nand the Medical Center. A specialized laboratory facility maintained by VINSE provides students in the minor with\ncapstone experiences that allow them to prepare and characterize a variety of nanostructured systems using in-\nhouse state-of-the-art instrumentation. This hands-on laboratory component enhances the attractiveness of\nstudents to both employers and graduate schools.\n \nThe minor in nanoscience and nanotechnology requires a total of 15 credit hours, distributed as follows:\n \nPage 233 of 1019\n1.

The minor is administered by the School of Engineering. Students who complete this minor\nwill have a toolkit that includes programming skills useful for simulating physical, biological, and social dynamics, as\nwell as an understanding of how to take advantage of modern software tools to extract meaningful information from\nsmall and large datasets.\n \nComputation is now an integral part of modern science and engineering. In science, computer simulation allows the\nstudy of natural phenomena impossible or intractable through experimental means. In engineering, computer\nsimulation allows the analysis and synthesis of systems too expensive, dangerous, or complex to model and build\ndirectly. Astronomers studying the formation of massive black holes, neuroscientists studying neural networks for\nhuman memory, mechanical engineers studying the designs of turbines and compressors, and electrical engineers\nstudying the reliability of electronics aboard spacecraft are united both in the computational challenges they face\nand the tools and techniques they use to solve these challenges.\n \nStudents in the program in scientific computing are taught techniques for understanding such complex physical,\nbiological, and also social systems. Students are introduced to computational methods for simulating and analyzing\nmodels of complex systems, to scientific visualization and data mining techniques needed to detect structure in\nmassively large multidimensional data sets, to high performance computing techniques for simulating models on\ncomputing clusters with hundreds or thousands of parallel, independent processors and for analyzing terabytes or\nmore of data that may be distributed across a massive cloud or grid storage environment.\n \nScientific computing at Vanderbilt is supported by faculty and includes students from a wide range of scientific and\nPage 235 of 1019\nengineering disciplines. While the content domain varies, these disciplines often require similar computational\napproaches, high-performance computing resources, and skills to simulate interactions, model real-life systems, and\ntest competing hypotheses. Scientific computing embodies the computational tools and techniques for solving many\nof the grand challenges facing science and engineering today.\n \nThe minor in scientific computing prepares students for advanced coursework that combines computational\napproaches with a substantive area of science or engineering. It prepares students for independent study with a\nfaculty member on a research project. It prepares students for advanced study in graduate school. It provides skills\nthat will be attractive to many employers after graduation.\n \nThe minor in scientific computing is distinct from the minor in computer science. Scientific computing uses\ncomputation as a tool to solve scientific and engineering problems in research and application. It is more focused on\nsimulation, numerical techniques, high performance computing, and higher-level methods than the minor in\ncomputer science, which is focused on the algorithms, systems, and technologies that enable such methods to be\ndeveloped and employed.\n \nThe minor in scientific computing requires 15 credit hours, distributed as follows:\n \n1.

Since then, Peabody College has retained its\nheritage while achieving new stature as a place where world-class research is conducted and translated into\nteaching, practice, policy, and service. Peabody's mission is characterized by practice-oriented academic programs,\na strong service ethic, groundbreaking research, and a pressing concern for addressing social problems in domestic\nand international contexts.\n \nThe college\u2019s faculty and students constitute a vibrant intellectual community answering pressing questions and\nexpanding knowledge about PreK\u201312 and higher education, including special education; psychology, especially\nfocused on families and children; the development of individuals and organizations; and educational administration,\nleadership, and policy. Peabody College understands the preparation of researchers, teachers, and leaders as\namong the most important things it does, and that building and sustaining an engaged academic community of\nlearners is central to achieving its mission.\n \nPeabody faculty and students engage in a broad spectrum of basic and applied research to generate new\nknowledge and translate that knowledge into practice. Current research findings inform classroom teaching at\nPeabody in every program. Moreover, Peabody faculty bring an interdisciplinary and entrepreneurial spirit to the\nresearch enterprise.\n \nWorking collaboratively, often through one of the college\u2019s research centers, faculty and students publish and\npresent their findings, apply them in real-world settings, and help to shape public debate about the nature and\nfuture of education and human development.\n \nThe college is devoted to enhancing opportunity in an increasingly diverse society. More than 1,900 students are\nenrolled at Peabody, with more than one-third of them in post-baccalaureate graduate or professional degree\nprograms.\n \nAll teacher education programs are accredited by the Council for the Accreditation of Education Preparation (CAEP).\nCounseling programs are accredited by the Council for the Accreditation of Counseling and Related Education\nPrograms (CACREP).\nCenters and Outreach Efforts\nFor more information about Peabody College's Centers and Outreach Efforts, please see here:\nhttps://peabody.vanderbilt.edu/research/research-centers.\nNext Steps at Vanderbilt University\nNext Steps at Vanderbilt is a four-year, nonresidential certification program for students with intellectual and\ndevelopmental disabilities, providing individualized programs of study in the areas of education, social skills, and\nvocational training. Next steps is a comprehensive transition program designated by the U.S. Department of\nEducation. This status recognizes the program's merits and allows eligible students to apply for federal financial aid\nfor tuition assistance.

These\nundergraduate programs are designed to prepare students for professional careers in their chosen fields. Programs\nfor Peabody students include course work in a Liberal Education Core, a professional core, a major area of\nspecialization, and electives. Peabody also provides professional education courses for College of Arts and Science\nstudents who want to prepare for teacher licensure.\n \nThe bachelor of science is granted on the basis of 120 semester hours of college work with a final grade point\naverage of 2.000, and completion of the Liberal Education Core and the requirements of the major.\nLiberal Education Core Program\nIn pursuit of breadth of knowledge and understanding about the world in which they live, all undergraduates\ncomplete the requirements of the Liberal Education Core program. This Liberal Education Core component of all\nPeabody undergraduate majors is intended to provide students with a solid foundation in the arts and sciences. The\ncore curriculum incorporates the study of human conditions that are universal. The Liberal Education Core involves\nstudy in the following areas:\n \nCommunications. The study of language in its written and spoken forms.\nMathematics/Quantitative Analysis. The study of mathematical concepts and procedures.\nSocial Sciences. The study of the past\u2014both the heritage of the United States and the more global human story.\nHumanities. The study of the universal language of the arts.\nNatural Sciences. The study of scientific process and interrelationships among the sciences.\n \nThrough the study of these universal subjects, concepts, and modes of thought, students gain a broad foundation\ntransferable to their futures. They will continue to grow within society and the classroom and will look at problems\nfrom different perspectives while maintaining curiosity.\n \nCourses identified to fulfill the Liberal Education Core requirement for each undergraduate major are listed in\nPeabody\u2019s Undergraduate Handbook (https://peabody.vanderbilt.edu/office-academic-services/). \n \nCourses used to satisfy these core requirements may also be counted toward the fulfillment of requirements in an\nacademic major. Special topics courses are ordinarily not acceptable for meeting Liberal Education Core\nrequirements. These courses require prior approval as substitute courses. Independent study courses are not\nacceptable for meeting Liberal Education Core requirements.\n \nTransfer students may use credits from other colleges to fulfill Peabody\u2019s Liberal Education Core requirements if the\ncredits are equivalent to the courses offered at Vanderbilt. For transfer students, credits are evaluated when the\nstudent enrolls at Peabody in order to determine which transfer courses will substitute for Peabody\u2019s Liberal\nEducation Core requirements. Requirements still to be fulfilled will be noted at that time.\nLicensure for Teaching\nSecurity Clearance\nDegree Audits\nScreening\nPage 243 of 1019\nScreening I (Formal Admission to an Undergraduate Teacher Education Program)\nScreening II (Admission to Student Teaching)\nStudent Teaching\nApplication for Teacher Licensure and University Recommendation for Licensure\nAccreditation\n \n \nPeabody offers programs leading to teacher licensure in the following areas: elementary (grades K\u20135), and\nsecondary education (grades 6\u201312) with endorsement in English, math, biology, chemistry, physics, earth science,\nhistory, and political science. (Added endorsements are available also in economics, psychology, and sociology for\nthose who will have a history endorsement.) An added endorsement program also is available in English as a Second\nLanguage (grades PreK\u201312). All of these programs are offered by the Department of Teaching and Learning.\n \nSpecial education\u2013interventionist (LD/BD for grades K\u20138 or 6\u201312) or comprehensive (multiple/severe for grades K\u2013\n12) are offered by the Department of Special Education.\n \nVanderbilt\u2019s Blair School of Music and Peabody College offer a program for students interested in teacher licensure\nwith endorsement in the following: (1) instrumental/general music (grades K\u201312), or (2) vocal/general music (grades\nK\u201312). Blair students complete the first part of the program as part of the bachelor of music degree and apply during\nthe senior year to continue into the master of education degree for a final year of professional education.\n \nStudents seeking licensure may enroll in Peabody College, the College of Arts and Science, or the Blair School of\nMusic. In all cases, most of the liberal arts course work is taken in the College of Arts and Science, and the\nprofessional education course work is taken at Peabody College.\n \nAll students completing a teacher education program at Vanderbilt are strongly advised to apply for a license in\nTennessee whether or not they plan to teach in this state. In addition, licensure is available by application in other\nstates. The student is responsible for applying for Tennessee licensure through the Office of Teacher Licensure. Each\nstate has its own application forms and procedures for licensure; information is available on the Office of Teacher\nLicensure website: peabody.vanderbilt.edu/teacher-licensure/. \n \nLicensure requirements continue to undergo revision. Students must meet licensure requirements in effect at the\ntime of their program completion, which may be different from requirements in effect at the time they entered the\nprogram. Each year, teacher education students should consult the current Vanderbilt Undergraduate Catalog or the\nPeabody Undergraduate Handbook. The website peabody.vanderbilt.edu/teacher-licensure/ provides additional\ninformation.\nSecurity Clearance\nAs part of the Peabody background check process you are required to pass a fingerprint criminal background check\nby the beginning of your first semester. Visit https://peabody.vanderbilt.edu/criminal-background-clearance for\ndetailed information.\nDegree Audits\nElectronic degree audits enable students and faculty advisers to track each student\u2019s progress in the degree\nprogram at Peabody. The departmental handbooks describe access to and use of online Peabody major degree\naudits to view program requirements recognized as \u201cmet\u201d or \u201cunmet\u201d at any time in the student\u2019s program. The\ndegree audit also denotes permissions for waivers or course substitutions. Degree audits are managed in the\nPeabody Office of Academic Services.\nPage 244 of 1019\nSCREENING\nStudents seeking teacher licensure must be approved by each department through which licensure is sought.\nSecondary licensure candidates should contact an adviser or the director of undergraduate studies in the\nappropriate Arts and Science department(s) to be informed of any specific departmental requirements or standards.\nThere are two points in each teacher education program when undergraduates must complete applications for\nscreenings by departmental faculty. Screening requirements continue to undergo revision and are subject to\nchange. Students must meet screening requirements in effect at the time of their application, which may be\ndifferent from requirements stated below. Screening reviews, described below, are important checkpoints that allow\nsuccessful students to   advance in the program. Attainment of 2.75 (4.0) cumulative grade point average and\ncompletion of required courses do not automatically qualify a student for continuation in the program.\n \nFaculty evaluation of a student\u2019s qualifications for continuation in a teacher education program include academic,\nperformance, and disposition factors such as the following:\n1. Dependability (as evidenced by good attendance in classes and practica and the completion of required\nassignments and procedures on time)\n2. Professional and ethical behavior (honesty, acceptance of responsibility, emotional maturity, etc.)\n3. Attitude and interpersonal skills (including the ability to work with children and with peers)\n4. Academic competence (It is possible for a student to meet minimum grade point requirements and pass all\ncourses and still have specific academic weaknesses which might cause denial of screening applications)\n5. Teaching competence (as evidenced by successful completion of practica requirements). It is possible for a\nstudent to meet minimum grade point requirements and pass all courses and still have specific performance\nweaknesses which might cause denial of screening applications.\nThese criteria rest on the professional judgment of faculty members. Whether a student meets them or not is\ndetermined by a vote of appropriate faculty. Undergraduate students seeking secondary education licensure must\nbe approved by the Department of Teaching and Learning faculty and also by the faculty of College of Arts and\nScience department(s) for the Arts and Science major(s).\n \nScreening deadlines are October 1 and February 1. Undergraduates must apply for Screening I during spring of the\nsophomore year or fall of the junior year. Screening II must be done in the fall of the senior year, restricting\nundergraduate student teaching to the spring of the senior year. Deadlines are firm; late applications will not be\naccepted. The Screening I and II application form should be submitted online no later than the deadline. (NOTE:\nScreening II applications require additional documents when submitted. See specific requirements with the\napplication.)\n \nStudents will be notified of results of the faculty vote at the end of the screening semester. In instances where there\nis a negative decision, the student wishing to appeal must do so in writing to the chairperson(s) of the department(s)\ndenying the application. If the initial decision is upheld and the student wishes to continue the appeal, a written\npetition should be filed with the Administrative Committee of Peabody College.\nScreening I (Formal Admission to an Undergraduate Teacher Education Program)\nEach student seeking teacher licensure must be formally admitted to the teacher education program(s) by\ncompleting an online application for Screening I review by the faculty of the department(s) in which endorsement(s)\nis/are sought. Candidates normally apply for Screening I during spring of the sophomore year or fall of the junior\nyear, depending on their program area (candidates should consult their department handbook for timelines in their\nprogram area). Deadlines are February 1 in the spring and October 1 in the fall. Students who transfer more than 60\nhours to Vanderbilt from another institution must apply for admission to the teacher education program by the\nscreening deadline of their second semester at Vanderbilt.\n \nAn initial screening review by the faculty will occur soon after the Screening I deadline. If there are concerns noted,\nthe student will be counseled. The final faculty review and decision will be done toward the end of the semester.\n \nPage 245 of 1019\nCriteria for Screening I (formal admission to teacher education) are:\nA. Specific Academic Criteria\n1. Test scores (SAT composite score of 780 or ACT 21, OR passing scores on the Praxis I Core Academic\nSkills for Educators) or university credit in reading, writing, and mathematics courses.\n2. Minimum cumulative grade point average of 2.75 (4-point scale)\n3. Successful completion of at least two of the required professional education courses as defined by the\nprogram area with a minimum grade of C+\n4. Department interview\nB. Specific Faculty Evaluative Criteria: The faculty will consider the disposition criteria of dependability,\nprofessional and ethical behavior, attitude and interpersonal skills, and teaching competence as itemized at\nthe beginning of the Screening section.\nScreening II (Admission to Student Teaching)\nAdmission to Student Teaching is not automatic when prerequisite course work and field experiences have been\ncompleted. All students must submit the online Screening II application by October 1 in the fall of the senior year. At\nthe time of screening application, the student should be enrolled in any remaining prerequisite courses. No course\nwork may be taken during the semester of student teaching and seminar.\n \nAfter an initial review in the Office of Teacher Licensure, the Screening II application and other submitted materials\nwill be considered by departmental faculty according to the following criteria for Screening II approval to student\nteach:\nA. Specific Academic Criteria\n1. Formal admission to a teacher education program granted (completion of Screening I)\n2. First semester senior standing (for student teaching in the spring of the senior year)\n3. Successful completion (C+ or above) of all courses required and prerequisite to student teaching as\ndefined by the program area\n4. Minimum cumulative grade point average of 2.75 (4.0 scale)\n5. Satisfactory performance (C+ or above) in course work in areas in which teacher licensure is sought\n6. Successful completion of Standard First Aid and CPR training (attach certificate copies to the Screening\nII application)\nB. Specific Faculty Evaluative Criteria: The faculty will consider the disposition criteria of dependability,\nprofessional and ethical behavior, attitude and interpersonal skills, and teaching competence as itemized at\nthe beginning of the Screening section.\nEach Screening II application requires additional documents, depending on the program. A copy of first aid and CPR\nverification of training completed within the previous two years must be submitted to the Office of Teacher\nLicensure by the October 1 or February 1 deadline. In addition, some programs have additional requirements that\nare prerequisite to Screening II application. Students should consult departmental handbooks. Screening II\napplicants who are approved to student teach will receive notification of their student teaching placements no later\nthan during the Student Teacher Orientation at the beginning of the student teaching semester.\n \nStudents who have passed Screening II are assigned two specific student teaching placements in the Nashville area.\nStudent Teaching\nVanderbilt students seeking teacher licensure must successfully complete a 15-week semester of full-time student\nteaching in two different grade levels in Nashville area public schools and must be recommended for licensure by\nthe supervisors of student teaching and departmental faculty. Student teaching may be done only in the spring\nsemester. Prior to the start of student teaching, all prerequisite courses must have been completed, the cumulative\nGPA must be at least 2.75, and the appropriate departmental faculties must have voted to approve the candidate for\nstudent teaching during the previous semester as part of the Screening II application process. The Tennessee State\nDepartment of Education and Metropolitan Nashville Public Schools prohibit student teachers from taking courses\nduring student teaching. See the departmental Undergraduate Handbook for details.\nApplication for Teacher Licensure and University Recommendation for Licensure\nAll students completing the teacher education program at Vanderbilt are strongly advised to apply for a license in\nTennessee whether or not they plan to teach in this state. In addition, licensure is available in most other states.\nPage 246 of 1019\nThe student is responsible for applying for Tennessee licensure through the Office of Teacher Licensure. Each state\nhas its own application forms and procedures for licensure; information is available on the Office of Teacher\nLicensure website.\n \nTo be licensed through Vanderbilt\u2019s teacher education program, a graduate must earn a positive licensure\nrecommendation from the university. The university\u2019s decision to recommend a candidate is based upon the\nfollowing:\n1. Maintaining the grade point average required for admission to the teacher education program (2.75 on a 4.0\nscale).\n2. For Tennessee licensure, achieving the state minimum score on all required parts of the PRAXIS II Series and\nedTPA (scores must be sent to the Vanderbilt Office of Teacher Licensure\u2013code R 1871, and the Tennessee\nDepartment of Education\u2013code R 8190).*\n3. Receiving a positive recommendation from the student\u2019s department as a result of the student teaching\nexperience (Pass in student teaching does not guarantee a favorable recommendation).\n*Testing requirements are changing almost annually; check instructions in the Office of Teacher Licensure or at\nets.org/praxis/ before registering to take the exam.\nAccreditation\nVanderbilt University is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges\n(SACSCOC) to award baccalaureate, masters, and doctorate degrees. Degree-granting institutions also may offer\ncredentials such as certificates and diplomas at approved degree levels. Questions about the accreditation of\nVanderbilt University may be directed in writing to the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on\nColleges at 1866 Southern Lane, Decatur, GA 30033-4097, by calling (404) 679-4500, or by using information\navailable on SACSCOC\u2019s website (www.sacscoc.org).\n \nVanderbilt is accredited by the Council for the Accreditation of Education Preparation (CAEP) and its teacher\nlicensure programs also are approved by the Tennessee Department of Education and the following specialty\nprofessional associations:\n \nNational Council for Teachers of English (NCTE)\nCouncil for Exceptional Children (CEC)\nCouncil for Accreditation of Counseling and Related Educational Programs (CACREP)\nAssociation for Childhood Education International (ACEI)\nAmerican Speech-Language-Hearing Association (ASHA)\nNational Council for the Social Studies (NCSS)\nNational Council for Teachers of Mathematics (NCTM)\nNational Science Teachers Association (NSTA)\nAccreditation Council for Education in Nutrition and Dietetics (ACEND)\nPage 247 of 1019\nSpecial Program in Peabody College\nPeabody Scholars Program\nFirst-year students who achieve academic distinction during their first semester at Vanderbilt are invited to apply to\nthe Peabody Scholars Program. The Peabody Scholars Honors Program was established to offer particularly\npromising undergraduates at Peabody College opportunities for intellectual adventure, community service, and\nresearch. Emphasizing a theme of personal, professional, and civic creativity, the program is designed to foster\nstudents\u2019 potential by offering breadth through exposing students to a variety of academic and social experiences\nand depth by engaging in service-learning and independent research.\n \nTo graduate with honors through Peabody Scholars, scholars need to earn 24 points within the program. Scholars\nearn points from a series of required components as well as optional enrichment programming. All freshman\nPeabody Scholars participate in a 3-credit-hour Honors Seminar during the spring semester of their first year. In the\nsophomore year, scholars work together on a meaningful immersive service project in the local community. Each\nPeabody Scholar is offered a summer stipend (between sophomore and junior years) to support engagement in an\nindividual service or intensive research project (either domestic or abroad). In the junior year, scholars engage in\nindependent research projects with a faculty member. Senior scholars participate in both  scholarly and cultural\nevents. The Peabody Scholars Program also offers professional development, networking, and mentoring. The full\nlist of current programming is available on the program website. In sum, the Peabody Scholars Program offers a rich\narray of enrichment experiences and opportunities.\n \nPeabody freshmen may apply for the Peabody Scholars Program in the fall of their first semester at Vanderbilt.\nSelections will be made prior to the beginning of the spring semester. To be accepted into the program, students\nmust have a first-semester GPA of 3.6. To remain in good standing in the program, students must maintain a\nminimum grade point average of 3.0.

The major is designed to provide a\nstrong background in the social and behavioral sciences related to child development, a focused understanding of\nthe scientific study of children and the contexts in which they develop, and opportunities for supervised and\nindependent research on aspects of child development in ways that enable students to link theories and prior\nresearch to research design and data on children\u2019s development. The major is excellent preparation for graduate\nstudy in selected social science and professional fields (e.g., psychology, medicine, nursing, education, public\npolicy) and offers an excellent complementary (or second) major for undergraduate students simultaneously\npursuing a major in cognitive studies, elementary education, human and organizational development, or special\neducation.\n \nThe child development curriculum is designed to ensure that students develop a background in the liberal arts and\nsciences; a clear understanding of the theories, major research findings, and research methods central to the field of\nchild development; and an area of focus or expertise in child development. Development of background in the\nliberal arts and sciences occurs within the context of the Liberal Education Core, composed of required and elective\ncourses in communications, humanities, mathematics, natural sciences, and social sciences. A clear understanding\nof theory and research central to the field is developed through the major core courses. These include an overview\nof child development, courses focused on the domains of psychological processes central to human development\n(cognition; social and personality development), courses related to major epochs of child development (infancy and\nadolescence), and courses devoted to the major research methodologies in the field (experimental, observational,\npsychometric). Students select an area of concentration (major elective area) to complement the field as a whole.\nPage 254 of 1019\nHonors Program\nThe Honors Program in child development offers qualified majors the opportunity to conduct individual research\nprojects in collaboration with faculty members. This research experience culminates in the writing and public\npresentation of a senior thesis. Students who major in child development are eligible to apply for the Honors\nProgram at the end of their sophomore year if they have an overall grade point average of at least 3.2 and at least a\n3.2 in child development courses.\n \nStudents who complete the program successfully and who have a final grade point average of at least 3.2 will\nreceive Honors or Highest Honors in child development. The program should substantially aid those intending to do\ngraduate work. More specific information concerning admission to and the requirements of the Honors Program is\navailable from the director of the Honors Program, the director of undergraduate studies, or the department\neducation coordinator.\nCurriculum\nStudents take a minimum of 120 hours, distributed as follows:\nLiberal Education Core Requirements. Minimum 40 hours.\nThe Liberal Education Core is composed of required course work from the areas of Communications, Humanities,\nMathematics, Science, Cultural Studies, Social Science, and Electives. Listings of all courses that may fulfill these\nareas are located online in the Peabody Undergraduate Handbook (http://peabody.vanderbilt.edu/admin-\noffices/oas/downloads.php).\n \nA score of 5 on the AP Statistics exam will waive students from the Statistics Liberal Education Core requirement\n(applied to all PSYHD majors).

Training provided by the quantitative methods minor can\nprovide a competitive edge on the job market or for future graduate study. Many advances in quantitative methods\nused in the social sciences and education are not covered in standard undergraduate introductory statistics courses.\nThis minor exposes students to more recent developments in quantitative methods with concrete applications to\npractice. The quantitative methods minor helps students become better consumers and producers of scientific\nresearch. Students will have the opportunity to learn from leading experts in the statistical analysis of social science\ndata.\nStructure of the Minor\nPrerequisite for the minor is completion of the introductory statistics sequence that is already required by the\nundergraduate psychology majors. This sequence is:\n \nPSY-PC 2110 or PSY 2100 or ECON 1500 or MATH 2810 or a 5 on AP Stat Exam\nAnd\nPSY-PC 2120. Statistical Analysis (3 hours)\n \nThe quantitative methods minor is an 18-hour minor. The 18 hours include both PSY-PC-2110 (or PSY 2100 or ECON\n1500 or MATH 2810 or a 5 on AP Stat Exam) and PSY-PC 2120, and these serve as prerequisite courses for the\nelectives. Following completion of these prerequisite courses (6 hours; required), the minor requires four additional\ncourses (12 hours; electives). Any four courses offered by the Quantitative Methods program are applicable. At\nmost, three hours of directed research/independent study can count toward the minor. Students with interest in\ndirected research/independent study can contact individual quantitative methods faculty directly.\n \nCourses that would satisfy the elective requirements (pick 4):\nPSY-PC 3722. Psychometric Methods\nPSY-PC 3724. Psychometrics\nPSY-PC 3727. Modern Robust Statistical Methods\nPage 265 of 1019\nPSY-PC 3730. Applied Latent Class and Mixture Modeling\nPSY-PC 3732. Latent Growth Curve Modeling\nPSY-PC 3735. Correlation and Regression\nPSY-PC 3738. Introduction to Item Response Theory\nPSY-PC 3743. Factor Analysis\nPSY-PC 3746. Multivariate Statistics\nPSY-PC 3749. Applied Nonparametric Statistics\nPSY-PC 3850. Independent Study\n \nPrior to enrolling in a specific course, please contact the instructor regarding prerequisite courses. Undergraduates\nmay request to be enrolled in QM graduate courses not yet cross-listed as undergraduate courses by using a\nsubstitution form, with permission of instructor. We anticipate adding more courses to the list of electives, which will\nbe posted on the minor's website. \n \nFor inquiries about the quantitative methods minor, email kris.preacher@vanderbilt.edu. \nTeaching and Learning\nMajors in Early Childhood and Elementary\nEducation, and Secondary Education and Minor in\nMultilingual Learner Education\nElementary Education\nSecondary Education\nMinor in Multilingual Learner Education\n \nCHAIR Noel Enyedy\nASSOCIATE CHAIR Melanie Hundley\nDIRECTOR OF GRADUATE STUDIES Heidi Carlone\nDIRECTOR OF UNDERGRADUATE STUDIES Catherine McTamaney\nElementary Education\nThe specialization in elementary education is field-oriented and designed to prepare students to teach children in\ngrades K-5. Beginning in the freshman year, students observe and participate in local schools and experimental\nclassrooms on campus. Most Liberal Education Core courses are taken in the College of Arts and Science.\n \nStudents must combine a specialization in elementary education with a second major in the liberal arts, an\ninterdisciplinary major, or another major offered by Peabody College or the College of Arts and Science. Course work\nbeyond the standard 120-hour program may be required for some double majors.\n \nVanderbilt students seeking teacher licensure must apply through the Office of Teacher Licensure at Vanderbilt and\nmust meet licensure requirements in effect at the time of their graduation, which may be different from licensure\nPage 266 of 1019\nrequirements in effect at the time they entered the program. Licensure requirements are currently undergoing\nchange. Each year, teacher licensure candidates should consult the current Vanderbilt Undergraduate Catalog, the\nUndergraduate Guide to Teacher Licensure published by the Vanderbilt Office of Teacher Licensure, and the\nUndergraduate Handbook published by the Office of Undergraduate Academic Affairs.\n \nB.S. Degree Requirements\nElementary Education (K\u20135 Licensure)\nStudents take a minimum of 120 hours, distributed as follows:\n \nLiberal Education Core Requirements.

Gilchrist\nMajor in Human and Organizational Development\nThe Human and Organizational Development (HOD) major prepares students to address complex social problems in\norganizations and communities. The HOD curriculum challenges students to view human problems and their\nsolutions in organizations and communities. The HOD curriculum challenges students to view human problems and\ntheir solutions as embedded in broader social ecological systems. HOD coursework draws on a range of disciplinary\nperspectives (e.g., psychology, organizational studies, sociology, political science, anthropology, geography,\neconomics), and explores societal issues across distinct levels of analysis (e.g., individual, group, organization,\ncommunity, policy, international). HOD coursework engages students through active learning approaches involving\nteams, simulations, case studies, field experiences, and interaction with academic researchers and professionals in\nthe field. These experiences support the development of the following HOD Core Competencies that will help\nstudents succeed in people-oriented organizational roles:\n \n1. Written communication - with emphasis on developing a clear, concise, expository style and mastering the\npractical forms used in professional situations.\n2. Oral presentation - with emphasis on making informative and persuasive presentations with the effective use\nof technology and media.\n3. Analytic and critical thinking - with emphasis on data-driven analysis, creativity, and systems thinking to\nrecognize, define and work to solve personal, professional, organizational, and social problems.\n4. Interpersonal communication - with emphasis on inquiry, advocacy, leadership, and conflict resolution skills.\n5. Collaborative work behaviors - with emphasis on motivating others, managing talent, and teamwork.\nHOD requirements consist of the Peabody Liberal Education Core and HOD Major Requirements, plus the successful\ncompletion of an HOD capstone experience.\n \nPeabody Liberal Education Core \nThe Liberal Education Core provides students with a strong liberal arts foundation. It is composed of required\ncoursework from the areas of Communications, Humanities, Quantitative Analysis, Natural Science, Social Science,\nand Electives. Listings of all courses that may fulfill these areas are located online in the Peabody Undergraduate\nHandbook (peabody.vanderbilt.edu/admin-offices/oas/downloads.php). In addition, students must complete two\nwriting intensive courses. See the \"Writing Requirement\" section of the general Peabody academic policy section of\nPage 274 of 1019\nthe Undergraduate Catalog.\n \nHOD Major Requirements\n \nHuman and Organizational Development Professional Core (15 hours): The HOD Core introduces students to\necological systems thinking, theories of human, group, community, organizational, and policy development, and\nquantitative & qualitative approaches to research and problem solving. Professional core courses are designed to\nhelp students:\n1. Understand the basic principles and typical patterns of human development across the life span and use this\nknowledge to understand their own behavior and the behavior of others;\n2. Understand the principles of group dynamics and use this knowledge to provide leadership and facilitate\ndecision making in small group and team settings;\n3. Understand theories of organizations and apply them to the solution of organizational problems;\n4. Understand the critical role that community contexts play in shaping individual, group, and organizational\nwell-being;\n5. Apply quantitative and qualitative methods of systematic inquiry and analysis;\n6. Understand public policy processes and the factors that influence policy making;\n7. Understand the ethical dimensions of personal and organizational decisions and apply this understanding to\nanalyze social issues and make professional and personal decisions;\n8. Develop enhanced skills of synthesis including the ability to integrate ideas from various sources and to\ndesign innovative programs.\n9. Understand and engage in practices and policies that ensure inclusion of diverse populations and\nperspectives.\nThe program design will endow you with the skills and knowledge needed to succeed in a people-oriented\norganizational role.\n \nHuman and Organizational Development Domains: Domain courses build on the foundational courses in the HOD\nProfessional Core. Students will choose courses that will help them develop breadth and depth across levels of\nanalysis in topic areas of interest. Students must complete two courses in each of the following three domains:\n \n   Individual/Interpersonal Domain: Courses in this domain delve deeper into personal and professional development\nand explore topics, including but not limited to, leadership, professional ethics, youth development, professional\n   development, and mental health and well-being. Through these courses students will develop professional skills in\ndata management, research, individual and team leadership, human-centered design, and interpersonal conflict\nresolution.\n \n   Organizational/Group Domain: Courses in this domain explore recent advances in organizational theory and\ninnovative management strategies in for-profit, non-profit, and public sector organizations in the U.S. and\ninternational contexts.    Course topics include, but are not limited to organizational effectiveness, organizational\nchange management, and social entrepreneurship. Courses use case studies and practical application to prepare\nstudents to engage organizational    challenges in an increasingly complex and dynamic world.\n \n   Community/Policy Domain: Courses in this domain invite students to critically examine the causes and\nconsequences of complex social problems from a systems perspective and explore community- and policy-level\napproaches to change    and intervention. Courses address a range of local and global topics and consider the\ndiverse perspectives of marginalized communities. These topics include, but are not limited to educational equity,\nenvironmental justice and    sustainability, violence prevention, and economic development, as well as  poverty-\nrelated challenges such as fair and affordable housing, employment, health disparities, transportation,\nneighborhood safety, and resource provision.\n \nHuman and Organizational Development Capstone: (12 credit hours/Summer or 15 credit hours/Fall or Spring\nPage 275 of 1019\nsemesters): The Capstone is the immersive learning academic semester for junior and senior students in the Human\nand Organizational Development (HOD) major at Vanderbilt University. Successful completion of the HOD Capstone\nsemester satisfies the Vanderbilt Immersion requirement. The Capstone is designed for students to apply the core\nHOD coursework and develop data-driven and research-grounded contributions to address human problems in\norganizations and communities. The HOD capstone requires 28 hours a week, at least 30% in person, fully in person\npreferred with the confirmed site and a weekly 3-hour seminar. The experience is possible in fall, spring or summer\nsemesters. The HOD Capstone office has preexisting relationships with sites in Nashville, Chicago, New York City,\nSan Francisco, Washington D.C. and London, England. However, students are not limited to these cities.\n \nThe HOD philosophy emphasizes the importance of connecting academic knowledge and theories to professional\npractice. HOD undergraduate core requirements offer an applied liberal arts education that will endow students with\nthe skills and knowledge needed to succeed in organizations and communities. The capstone semester is designed\nto provide students the opportunity to synthesize the HOD coursework and learning experiences in an\norganizational context - which is central to the foundation of the applied learning experience and mission of our\ndegree.\nHOD majors (juniors and seniors) who have successfully completed the HOD 4949 Capstone Design requirements,\napproved for the HOD Capstone by the HOD Capstone Office, and completed the HOD core class prerequisites\nincluding HOD 1250, 1300, 2100, 2400 (not required for students who entered Summer 2023 or later), 2500, and\n2700 are eligible to register for HOD 4950, 4951, 4952 and 4953.\n \nStudents enroll in a semester-long course, HOD 4949 in the fall to design a spring capstone and enroll in\nspring to design a summer or fall capstone. Note HOD 4949 Capstone Design is not offered in the\nsummer. The capstone design semester is an opportunity for students to explore, develop and confirm a successful\ncapstone experience. They partner with the HOD Capstone team for mentoring, coaching, connection events, and a\nvariety of campus partners to confirm their capstone site. The capstone semester provides a variety of opportunities\nfor students to integrate and apply earlier coursework in a civic/professional, research, international or creative\npartnership. Students design their capstone to align with their field of interest. They select opportunities that\nprovide valuable applied work experiences, build professional development competencies, and help launch their\npost-graduation careers. During the HOD capstone semester, students enroll in four courses that accompany their\ncapstone experience: HOD 4950 (P/F - 3 credit hours during summer; 6 hours during fall or spring) Organizational\nPartnership, HOD 4951 (3 hours) Critical Reflexivity and Systems Thinking, HOD 4952 (3 hours) Mapping Future\nDevelopment, and HOD 4953 (3 hours) Analysis and Contribution. For additional information on the HOD Capstone\nvisit our website HERE.\nCurriculum\nStudents take a minimum of 12 hours, distributed as follows:\n \nLiberal Education Core Requirements.

It offers\noutstanding undergraduate HOD majors an opportunity to become involved in research teams with professors and\ngraduate students. The program will help students develop skills in empirical research methods, writing, and\npresentation to provide a firm foundation for advanced graduate or professional training. The HOD Honors Programs\nrequires a serious time commitment to a research project.\n \nApplication: Students may apply for the honors program at any time from the second semester of their sophomore\nyear to the summer before their senior year. The application must be approved by the faculty member with whom\nthe student will work, and will outline the nature of the research project, which will ordinarily be an extension of the\nfaculty member\u2019s ongoing research. Students must have completed HOD 1250, HOD 1300, HOD 2100, HOD 2500,\nand a college statistics course and have an overall GPA of at least 3.6. This minimum GPA must be maintained to\ngraduate with honors.\n \nApplications will be evaluated by the HOD Honors Director, who will decide on admission, taking into consideration\nthe numbers of applicants.\n \nRequirements: Upon admission students will complete two (not necessarily back-to-back) semesters of honors\nseminar (for six total hours of credit), which satisfy one course in two HOD domains of the student's choosing, plus\nthe writing course requirement. In the course, they will learn advanced research methods. In addition to the honors\nseminar, the student will work with the faculty sponsor on research for up to ten hours per week. Students must\ncomplete a pilot study (first semester) and an empirical (quantitative or qualitative) honors thesis (second semester)\nthat is approved by two faculty readers, and orally present both pilot study and thesis. Although not required,\nhonors projects may be coordinated with the HOD Capstone with permission of the instructor, the student's Honor's\nadvisor, and HOD Capstone Director, and may be taken in the same semester as Capstone. Students are additionally\nencouraged to attend departmental colloquia and to take at least one graduate course in their area of interest.\n \nAwards of departmental Honors in HOD will depend on successful completion of the course and the thesis. Highest\nHonors and Best HOD Honors Thesis may be awarded by vote of the Honors Committee.\nThe Minor in Human and Organizational Development\nThe HOD minor requires 15 unique hours that are not counted toward any other major or minor.

Wehby\nASSOCIATE CHAIR Kimberly Paulsen\nDIRECTOR OF GRADUATE STUDIES Robert M. Hodapp\nDIRECTOR OF PROFESSIONAL STUDIES Alexandra Da Fonte\nDIRECTOR OF UNDERGRADUATE STUDIES Andrea M. Capizzi\n \nThe undergraduate program in special education prepares students to work with persons with disabilities and leads\nto licensure in special education. Students pursue an interdisciplinary major in exceptional learning with emphasis in\none of the two specialty areas: high-incidence disabilities (interventionist program K-8 and/or 6-12) or multiple and\nsevere disabilities (comprehensive program). This major can be combined with other majors such as cognitive\nstudies, child development, or majors in the College of Arts and Science. The program is field- oriented and problem\ncentered, with most professional courses requiring direct involvement with individuals with disabilities. Beginning in\nPage 282 of 1019\nthe freshman year, students observe and work in a variety of educational settings in local schools and in classrooms\noff campus.\n \nVanderbilt students seeking teacher licensure must apply through the Office of Teacher Licensure at Vanderbilt and\nmust meet licensure requirements in effect at the time of their graduation, which may be different from licensure\nrequirements in effect at the time they entered the program. Each year, teacher licensure candidates should consult\nthe current Vanderbilt Undergraduate Catalog, the Undergraduate Guide to Teacher Licensure published by the\nVanderbilt Office of Teacher Licensure, and the Undergraduate Handbook published by the Office of Administration\nand Records.\nHonors Program\nThe Honors Program in Special Education offers qualified majors the opportunity to gain experience in conducting\nresearch in collaboration with a faculty mentor. This experience culminates in the writing and presentation of a\nsenior project. Students who major in special education are eligible to apply for the Honors Program in the spring of\ntheir sophomore year if they have an overall grade point average of at least 3.5. Students who are accepted into the\nHonors Program, successfully complete the program, and maintain the required grade point averages, will graduate\nwith Honors in Special Education. Specific information concerning admission to and the requirements of the Honors\nProgram in Special Education is available from Professor Andrea Capizzi, director of undergraduate studies for the\nDepartment of Special Education. Students should be aware that participation in the Honors Program is quite time-\nintensive and represents a substantial commitment of effort across at least three semesters. Therefore, potential\nparticipants must carefully consider whether they are able to, and want to, devote the required time and energy to\nthis program.\nB.S. Degree Requirements\nSpecializations are available in high-incidence disabilities/interventionist (grades K\u20138/6\u201312 interventionist licensure),\nand severe disabilities (grades K\u201312 comprehensive licensure). Total hours will vary depending on the area of\nspecialization.\n \nStudents take a minimum of 120 hours, distributed as follows:\nLiberal Education Core Requirements. Minimum 60 hours.\nThe Liberal Education Core is composed of required course work from the areas of Communications, Humanities,\nMathematics, Science, Cultural Studies, Social Science, and Electives.

Sauer\n \nCOURSES OFFERED: ANTH, KICH\n \nAnthropology is the study of human diversity in all times and places. It brings together perspectives from the\nsciences and humanities to illuminate different aspects of the human past, the human body, and contemporary\nsocial life. Global perspectives, fieldwork and experiential learning, and concerns with ethics, justice, and social well-\nbeing are hallmarks of anthropology.\n \nVanderbilt\u2019s program has a strong research focus on Latin America and historically marginalized groups, especially\nindigenous people and descendants of the African diaspora.\n \nStudents majoring in anthropology take courses in several subfields, each of which looks at humanity from a\ndifferent perspective. Cultural anthropology examines the relationships, beliefs, values, and political-economic\npractices that shape individual behavior, community life, and power in modern societies. Archaeology studies\nsocieties through their material remains, enabling long-term perspectives on the human past as well as connections\nto present-day descendant communities. Linguistics explores relations between language and culture. Biological\nanthropology examines topics such as community health in the past and present, forensic science, genetics,\nevolution, human biology, and bioethics. Courses cluster around themes of cross-cultural health, biology, food, and\nmedical systems; inequality, power, and social-political relations; material culture, human-environment relations,\nand spatial analysis; religion and politics; and worldviews, language, and cognition. Many courses are\ninterdisciplinary in nature, with connections to programs such as Biology; Earth and Environmental Science;\nMedicine, Health, and Society; Human and Organizational Development; History; Classics and Mediterranean\nStudies; Sociology; Jewish Studies; African American and Diaspora Studies; Latin American Studies; Asian Studies,\nand others, and attracts students from all four Undergraduate colleges. Unless indicated otherwise in the course\ndescription, anthropology courses have no prerequisites and are open to all majors and non-majors.\n \nKnowledge of the diversity of human histories and lifeways is vital to imagining alternative paths to a better society.\nAnthropology develops this knowledge through experiential learning that challenges students to go beyond the\nfamiliar, to see, understand, create, and interact in new ways. This preparation is useful in all professional careers\nthat involve understanding human behavior, working with people from different backgrounds, analyzing complex\ninformation, and thinking holistically about the conditions that shape people\u2019s lives.\nProgram of Concentration in Anthropology\nThe major in anthropology requires completion of at least 30 credit hours of course work, as follows:\n1. 6 credit hours. Two 1000-level surveys selected from the subfields of anthropology: 1101 (Cultural\nPage 293 of 1019\nAnthropology), 1201 (Archaeology), 1301 (Biological Anthropology), 1601 (Linguistic Anthropology). A course\nin a third subfield is strongly recommended (in consultation with the adviser).\n2. 3 credit hours. A seminar on anthropological theory (2101 or 2102).

Our courses\nemphasize creative and critical approaches to learning. The department of art offers a rigorous, socially minded,\nand research-driven curriculum. Students engage in an immersive laboratory of fearless experimentation and\nchallenge the rapidly expanding role of art in our society. Through trans-disciplinary thinking and experimental\nmethodologies, students utilize a range of artistic disciplines in a state-of-the-art facility. Equal emphasis is placed\non both individual and collective exploration, where students are encouraged to develop relationships across the\nuniversity and broader communities.\n \nMany students will use the program in art as a foundation for careers in which creativity and visual studies are\nespecially valued, as the basis for advanced training in professional schools (such as art, architecture, museum\nstudies), and for employment in galleries, museums, commercial art, or design-related fields. An important goal of\nthe department is to help students become readers of the rich visual environment in our culture throughout their\nlives, as well as to encourage creative approaches to learning in all disciplines.\n \nThe Department of Art offers several opportunities for extracurricular activities in the arts including a student-run art\ngallery, and Space 204 arts laboratory which hosts exhibitions and workshops throughout the year. Studio VU\nlecture series brings some of the most important artists working today to campus for lectures and one-on-one studio\nvisits with students.\n \nSince 1984 the Department of Art has supervised the Margaret Stonewall Wooldridge Hamblet Award given to an\neligible senior art major. This prestigious award provides the means for travel and independent art activity for one\nyear, culminating in a one-person exhibition at Vanderbilt. Our immersive program includes both junior and senior\nmajor trips to New York and other important art destinations.\n \nMany other prizes are awarded in our department. The Allan P. Deloach Memorial Prize in Photography was\nestablished in 2000 in memory of Allan Deloach (B.A. 1963) by two of his colleagues at IBM. This cash award is open\nto any student who has taken a studio class in any discipline at Vanderbilt. Midsouth Ceramics awards are given to\nthe top three ceramic projects in the annual open house, and the Plaza Artists Materials awards are given to four\nstudents each year. All competitions are judged by outside professional artists.\n \nProgram of Concentration in Art\nThe art major requires 30 credit hours and presents students the opportunity to explore their ideas conceptually, as\nwell as to learn the technical skills involved in the creation of art. The program offers a wide range of classes and\nmedia. Our students are offered a strong grounding in traditional processes such as drawing, painting, ceramics,\nand sculpture, as well as the opportunity to explore contemporary processes involving video, performance, digital\nphotographic, and new media, installation, and social interactive art practice. Our diverse faculty utilizes a wide\nrange of teaching styles and aesthetic philosophies. We consider how ideas have been developed through the\ncenturies as well as how specific techniques have been used to enrich the expression of an idea. In addition to\nmodern art history offerings, art majors are encouraged to take courses in pre-Renaissance, non-Western art\nhistory, philosophy of aesthetics, and film. The Contemporary Art Maymester offers an opportunity to study\nPage 296 of 1019\ncontemporary art in a concentrated manner.\nRequirements for the Program of Concentration in Art\nFoundation Requirement (3 credit hours)\nARTS 1101, 1102, or 1104 \nStudio Requirements (15 credit hours)\nAny ARTS courses with the exception of ARTS 1099 or ARTS 1800.\n   Within the 15 credit hours, students must take at least one 2000-level or higher ARTS course.\n \nRelated Requirement (6 credit hours), which must include one course (3 credit hours) of each of the following:\nARTS 1800, Sources of Contemporary Art\nAny HART course or one course from the following: ARTS 1099; CMA 1600, 2300; PHIL 3014\nThe department highly recommends taking ARTS 1800, Sources of Contemporary Art course prior to the senior year.\n \nDirected Study (6 credit hours)\nARTS 3970, Directed Study: Senior Show and Contemporary Practices\nARTS 3971, Independent Research: Senior Show\nMajors are required to complete the Independent Research course, ARTS 3971, their senior year.

Chemical biology and biochemistry use\nchemical insight, techniques, and tools to study or manipulate biological systems. They are the cornerstones of\nmedical technology and therapeutics. To provide students with training in modern principles at a chemistry-biology\ninterface, Vanderbilt\u2019s interdisciplinary major in biochemistry and chemical biology incorporates expertise from\nmultiple departments in the university. Students receive a broad background in the natural sciences (chemistry,\nbiology, physics) and mathematics, followed by fundamental core training in principles of biochemistry and chemical\nbiology that involves both theoretical and laboratory course work. Students then pursue an area of emphasis in\neither biochemistry or chemical biology through upper-level elective courses. Students participate in independent\nresearch in laboratories of biochemistry and chemical biology faculty. Additional research experience is available in\nthe Honors Program.\n \nProgram of Concentration\nThe biochemistry and chemical biology major tracks share fundamental core elements but have a distinct set of\nfoundational courses, track-specific electives, and laboratory requirements. All students are required to complete a\nset of basic science and mathematics courses. The major consists of 32 credit hours beyond these basic science and\nmathematics courses. All students complete 12 credit hours of core courses, 14 credit hours of either biochemistry\nor chemical biology track, and 6 credit hours of general electives. For suggested paths of completion, see the\nProgram in Biochemistry and Chemical Biology website.\n \nRequired Math and Science Courses for Both Tracks\n(38 credit hours)\n \nBiological Sciences \u2014 BSCI 1510, 1511, 1510L, and either 1511L or 1512L\nChemistry \u2014 CHEM 2221 or 2211, CHEM 2222 or 2212, CHEM 2221L and CHEM 2222L\nMathematics \u2014 MATH 1200 or 1300 and MATH 1201 or 1301\nPhysics \u2014 PHYS 1501 or 1601, PHYS 1502 or 1602, PHYS 1501L or 1601L, and PHYS 1502L or 1602L\n \nNote: These credit hours do not count toward the major.

The purpose of the Honors Program is to provide students with an intensive independent research experience\nin a host laboratory. Honors candidates must complete two semesters (3 credit hours each semester) of Honors\nResearch (BCB 4999). The successful completion of one semester of BCB 4999 may substitute for the BCB 4965\ncourse requirement. Upon entering the program at the end of the junior year, candidates assemble a committee of\nthe major research adviser and two additional faculty members appropriate to the area of research. As part of the\nresearch course work, the candidate will write an honors thesis.

Lewis, Marlon Thomas\n \nCOURSES OFFERED: BME\n \nThe foundations of biomedical engineering are the same as those in other engineering disciplines: mathematics,\nphysics, chemistry, and engineering principles. Biomedical engineering builds on these foundations to solve\nproblems in biology  and medicine over the widest range of scales-from the nanoscale and molecular levels to the\nwhole body. Biomedical engineering provides a robust platform for employment in the medical device and\ninstrumentation industries as well as careers in companies that specialize in the development and application of\nbiologics, biomaterials, computation, implants and processes. Our graduates gain entry into nationally recognized\ngraduate schools for continuing studies in biomedical engineering.\n \nBiomedical engineering is also a rigorous path for admission to and success in medical school for those students\nwilling and able to excel in mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, physiology, and engineering.\n \nThe Department of Biomedical Engineering at Vanderbilt is unique among biomedical engineering programs in its\nimmediate proximity to the world class Vanderbilt Medical Center, located on our compact campus. Our School of\nMedicine is among the top ten in funding from the National Institutes of Health and includes a National Cancer\nInstitute- recognized Comprehensive Cancer Center, a major children\u2019s hospital and a Level I trauma center. This\nproximity and the strong relationships among faculty across multiple schools stimulate high impact research and\nprovide unique educational and research opportunities for students.\n \nDegree Programs. The Department of Biomedical Engineering offers courses of study leading to the B.E., M.S.,\nM.Eng., and Ph.D. Vanderbilt biomedical engineering is a well-established program with undergraduate degrees\ngranted continuously since 1965. Our undergraduate curriculum undergoes regular review and revision to ensure\nrelevancy and to maintain full ABET accreditation. Students have complete flexibility in the selection of biomedical\nengineering, technical, and open electives. This allows students to design their own focus areas such as\nregenerative medicine and tissue engineering, wearables and point-of-care diagnostics, global health, surgery and\nengineering, robotics and prosthetics, lasers and medicine, medical imaging, biotechnology and nanomedicine,\nmedical technology and entrepreneurship.\n \nFacilities. The Department of Biomedical Engineering is located in Stevenson Center.

Beyer\n \nCOURSES OFFERED: CHBE\n \nChemical engineers play key roles in the development and production of commodity chemicals, pharmaceuticals,\nand bioengineered materials, high strength composites and specialty polymers, semiconductors and microelectronic\ndevices, and a wide range of ultrapure fine chemicals. Indeed, chemical engineering is essential for the operation of\ncontemporary society. The solutions to many of the problems that we face today\u2014e.g., energy, the environment,\ndevelopment of high-performance materials\u2014will involve chemical engineers.\n \nThe undergraduate program in chemical engineering prepares students to contribute to the solution of these and\nsimilar problems. Graduates find meaningful careers in industry, in government laboratories, and as consultants.\nSome continue their education through graduate studies in chemical engineering, business, law, or medicine.\n \nMission. The mission of the Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering is to educate those who will\nadvance the knowledge base in chemical engineering, become practicing chemical engineers, and be leaders in the\nchemical and process industries, academia, and government; to conduct both basic and applied research in\nchemical engineering and related interdisciplinary areas; and to provide service to the chemical engineering\nprofession, the School of Engineering, Vanderbilt University, the country, and the world.\n \nDegree Programs. The Department of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering offers the B.E. in chemical\nengineering and graduate study leading to the M.Eng., M.S., and Ph.D.\n \nUndergraduate chemical engineering students acquire a solid background in mathematics, chemistry, biology,\nphysics, and computing. The chemical and biomolecular engineering program has as its basis courses in transport\nphenomena, thermodynamics, separations, and kinetics. Other courses deal with the principles and techniques of\nchemical engineering analysis and design, along with economic analysis, process control, chemical process safety,\nbioprocessing, process simulation, and engineering ethics. Laboratory courses offer the student an opportunity to\nmake fundamental measurements of momentum, heat, and mass transport and to gain hands-on experience with\nbench scale and small scale pilot-plant equipment, which can be computer controlled. Effective report writing and\ntechnical communication are principal skills gained in the laboratory and design courses. Many students carry out\nindividual research projects.\n \nA specimen curriculum for a chemical engineering major follows. This standard program includes electives that\nstudents, in consultation with their faculty advisers, select to pursue breadth or a minor or focus area with their\nchemical engineering major. Specimen curricula with emphases in specific areas are available on the department\nwebsite. Double majors may be arranged in consultation with a faculty adviser.\n \nStudents are recommended to take the Fundamentals of Engineering Examination (FE) in their senior year. This is\nthe first step in obtaining a license as a professional engineer. The following courses are recommended for\npreparation for the FE: ECE 2112, CE 2200, and ME 2190.\n \nUndergraduate Honors Program. The Honors Program in chemical engineering provides an opportunity for selected\nPage 319 of 1019\nstudents to develop individually through independent study and research. General requirements are described in\nthe Special Programs chapter. The chemical and biomolecular engineering department requires a minimum overall\nGPA of 3.5. Acceptance to the program is made by petition to the faculty during the junior year. Transfer students\nmay be considered for admission after completing one semester at Vanderbilt.

This is accomplished by\nproviding students with a solid background in the disciplines of organic, analytical, inorganic, biological, and physical\nchemistry. The core courses in these areas, which are supported by a variety of practical experimental experiences\nin the laboratory, provide students with the skills needed to think critically about chemistry. After these core\ncourses, students delve deeper into an area of their choice. Recognizing the importance of research, which\nintegrates and makes sense of our collective body of knowledge, we encourage students to participate in\nundergraduate research. The chemistry major at Vanderbilt University meets the guidelines for the American\nChemical Society approved program of study in chemistry.\n \nProgram of Concentration in Chemistry\nThe chemistry program is organized into four parts. The first part is a general chemistry course sequence (CHEM\n1601\u20131602 and 1601L\u20131602L or AP credit) to serve as an entry point into the major. The second part consists of\nfoundation courses in the five major disciplines of chemistry: analytical (2100), biochemistry (BSCI 2520), inorganic\n(3010), organic (2221\u20132222 or 2211\u20132212), and physical (3300 or 3310). The third part of the chemistry major\nconsists of completing 8 credit hours of laboratory past 1601L\u20131602L. Four credit hours are from laboratory courses\n(2221L\u20132222L, 2100L, and 3315) associated with foundation courses. There are also 6 credit hours of a capstone\nlaboratory (4965\u20134966) designed to provide advanced laboratory experience.

This goal\nrequires going beyond technical competence in a balanced education to develop future leaders in the fields of\nconsulting, industry, business, law, government, and research.\n \nB.E. in civil engineering. Civil engineers must be able to face complex problems of modern society involving the\ndevelopment of physical facilities that serve the public while protecting the environment and preserving social\nvalues. Challenges facing civil and environmental engineers concern housing, urban transportation, pollution\ncontrol, water resources development, industrial development, maintaining and advancing our nation\u2019s aging\nPage 326 of 1019\ninfrastructure, and exploring space. Addressing these challenges with today\u2019s limited resources requires innovative\nand original ideas from highly-skilled engineers.\n \nUndergraduates majoring in civil engineering receive a strong background in mathematics, science, engineering\nscience, and engineering design. The program also includes courses in economics, humanities, social sciences,\nresources management, and public policy. Students participate in design teams and laboratory studies as well as\nclassroom activities. Use of various computer-based methods is integral to problem solving and design.\n \nVanderbilt\u2019s B.E. in civil engineering prepares students for entry-level positions in many specialty areas of civil\nengineering, as well as many other types of careers, such as business, construction, and law. Today, however, and\neven more so in the future, professional practice at a high level will require an advanced degree. We recommend\nthat students seriously consider pursuing the M.S. or M. Eng. soon after obtaining the B.E.\n \nB.E./M.Eng. Five Year Program. Students seeking advanced study in civil and environmental engineering may be\ninterested in the combined B.E./M.Eng., enabling students to complete the B.E. in civil engineering and M.Eng. in\ncivil engineering or environmental engineering in five years.\n \nConstruction Management Five Year Program. Students seeking advanced study in construction management may\nbe interested in the combined B.E./M.Eng., enabling students to complete the B.E. in civil engineering and M.Eng. in\ncivil engineering (construction management emphasis) in five years.\n \nUndergraduate Honors Program. Recognized with the diploma designation Honors in Civil Engineering, exceptional\nstudents may be invited in their junior year to participate in the civil engineering Honors Program. Designed as a\nunique individualized educational experience, participants work closely with departmental faculty members to tailor\na selection of courses that actively immerses them in a selected field of study. Experiences include enrollment in a 3\nsemester hour independent study course and participation in a summer research internship. Honors Program\nparticipants are especially well-prepared to enter graduate study, and they may count the independent study course\ntowards their civil engineering technical electives.\n \nFacilities. The civil engineering laboratory provides for static and dynamic testing of materials and structural\ncomponents and assemblies. Testing facilities include capabilities of testing composites, metals, and concrete under\nstatic loads, fatigue, base acceleration (to simulate seismic events) and intermediate to high speed impacts (to\nsimulate responses to blast events). Full soils testing facilities are available. Hydraulics facilities include several\nmodel flow systems to illustrate principles of fluid mechanics and hydrology. The transportation laboratory is\ncomputer-based, with emphasis on transportation systems and design, intelligent transportation systems, and\ngeographic information systems. The environmental laboratories are fully supplied with modern instrumentation for\nchemical, physical, biological, and radiological analysis of soils, sediments, water, wastewater, air, and solid waste.\nThey include equipment for the study of biological waste treatment, physical-chemical waste treatment,\ncontainment mass transfer, and state-of-the-art instrumentation.

Caferro, Phillip Ackerman-Lieberman\nAssociate Professors: Jelena Bogdanovic, Ari Bryen, Kathy Gaca, David Michelson, Joseph Rife\nAssistant Professor: James Zainaldin \nPrincipal Senior Lecturer: Daniel Solomon\nSenior Lecturers: Jason Harris, Isabella Reinhardt, Chiara Sulprizio\n \nCOURSES OFFERED: ARAM, CLAS, CHEB, GRK, LAT\n \nThe Department of Classical and Mediterranean Studies offers students an interdisciplinary perspective on the\nculture and history of a region at the crossroads of human civilization since antiquity. The study of the\nMediterranean world examines the influential achievements and legacy of the Greeks and Romans alongside the\nemergence and spread of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam to the East. It also explores the premodern to modern\ndevelopment of southern Europe, North Africa, and western Asia, which have variously responded to the ancient and\nmedieval past. The program offers courses in the history, religion, philosophy, art, literature, society, and culture of\nthe Mediterranean world. In teaching and research, the faculty promote the integrated study of past and present\nthrough both written and material sources\u2014textual, artifactual, visual, spatial\u2014and they embrace analytical\nPage 332 of 1019\ntechniques in the digital humanities. Students thus have the opportunity to learn several ancient and medieval\nlanguages of Europe and the Middle East and to pursue experiential learning overseas, from intensive modern\nlanguage study to archaeological fieldwork to the investigation of evolving cultural and natural landscapes.\n \nMajors in classical and Mediterranean studies are introduced to the distinctive geography and history of the region\nbut choose their courses in one of three tracks. These tracks have shared content but offer different viewpoints and\ntraining. Majors who expect to apply for graduate study should work closely with an adviser to devise an\nappropriate curriculum.\n \nStudents who pursue Classical and Near Eastern Languages and Cultures investigate one or more ancient to\nmedieval cultural tradition(s) in the Greco-Roman and Near Eastern spheres through the study of original texts and\ntheir historical setting, such as Greek tragedy, Latin oratory, Hebrew scripture, the Qur\u2019an, or early French romance.\n \nStudents who pursue Mediterranean Archaeology explore human diversity and experience from Classical Antiquity\nto the Middle Ages through the study of material and visual culture. They too learn to read textual sources while\nacquiring the skills of archaeological and art-historical research.\nStudents who pursue Mediterranean Studies, the most flexible track for a broad range of interests, can choose to\nengage with a variety of ancient, medieval, or modern topics through focused or comparative study.\n \nThe Department of Classical and Mediterranean Studies also offers a minor in Mediterranean Archaeology and a\nminor in Mediterranean Studies. A student cannot earn more than one minor in the program.\n \nThe Honors Program requires the production of a thesis representing advanced, original, and substantial research.\n \nStudents are strongly recommended to pursue study abroad in the Mediterranean or an adjacent region. The\ndepartment has long supported the Intercollegiate Center for Classical Studies, the American Academy in Rome, and\nthe American School of Classical Studies in Athens. Many different international experiences are possible through\nVanderbilt-approved semester programs, Maymesters, research projects, and summer study, for example, in Italy,\nGreece, and Israel. Students are encouraged to participate in local and regional conferences, where they can share\nthe results of collaborative or independent work. Those concentrating on Greek and/or Latin language who qualify\nacademically are invited to join Eta Sigma Phi, the national classics honor society.\n \nProgram of Concentration in Classical and Mediterranean Studies\nStudents majoring in Classical and Mediterranean Studies must take ten courses, including one foundation course\n(CLAS 1010). The major is arranged into three tracks and an honors track. Students must formally declare a track 1\u2013\n3 at the time the major is declared. A score of 4 or 5 on the AP Latin exam earns 3 hours of credit for Latin 2202,\nwhich may be applied toward any of the major tracks.

Students interested in pursuing the Honors Track should contact the director of undergraduate\nstudies for more information. To be considered for the Honors Track in Climate Studies, a student must have a\nminimum cumulative GPA of 3.4 and a minimum GPA of 3.6 for courses that count toward the major. Students\nshould express interest to the director of undergraduate studies before March 1 of their junior year. Students who\nare recommended for the program by the director of undergraduate studies will typically begin the program by\ntaking ENVS 4101W during the fall term of the senior year.  \nPage 338 of 1019\nThe Honors Track requires the following:\n \n1. Successful completion of requirements 1-7 in Program I, for a total of 30 credit hours. Requirements 1, 2, and 6\nmust be completed prior to beginning the honors courses.  \n \n2. Successful completion of at least two semesters of honors coursework (6 credit hours) for the Honors Track.\nStudents take ENVS 4101W or ENVS 4981 (Honors Research) during the first semester of their senior year, when\nthey develop the literature review and research plan. The first semester of honors coursework counts as part of\nrequirement 7 of Program I and can be used to fulfill the requirements for Program I should students not go on to\nfinish honors during the second semester of honors coursework.  After completing the first semester of honors\ncoursework, students then take a minimum of 3 and maximum of 6 credit hours of 4981 (Honors Research) during\nthe second semester, which is in addition to the 30 credits required to complete the standard major. Thus students\nmust take a minimum of 6 credit hours of honors coursework and may take up to 9 credit hours.\n \n3. In order to earn honors in Climate Studies, students must successfully complete, defend, and perform requested\nrevisions on the honors thesis before deadlines for graduation. Successful defense of the completed thesis is through\nan oral presentation and examination by the thesis adviser and a designated faculty reader near the end of the\nstudent's final semester. Revisions must be completed and the thesis submitted no later than the last day of\nundergraduate classes.\n \n4. Students meeting these requirements receive honors or highest honors in Climate Studies, depending on the\nquality of the thesis and performance on the defense.  Successful candidates will be recognized in the\ncommencement program and receive a Vanderbilt diploma that records honors or highest honors in Climate Studies.\n \nComprehensive Exam\nIn order to graduate with a climate studies major, students must take a comprehensive exam during their senior\nyear. The exam is not graded, and no grade will appear on the student's transcript. The purpose of the exam is to\ntest the extent to which climate studies majors are retaining core aspects of the climate & environmental studies\ncurriculum.\n \nMinor in Environmental and Sustainability Studies\n \nStudents who want to minor in environmental and sustainability studies must take a minimum of six courses (18\ncredit hours total) chosen from the courses listed below; additional relevant courses may be counted with approval\nof the director of the program. Courses must be distributed as follows: (A) one Natural Science- and Technology-\nIntensive course; (B) one Humanities course; (C) one Social-Behavioral Sciences and Policy-Intensive course; (D) two\nadditional courses from B and/or C; and (E) a capstone course. No more than two courses may be at the 1000 level.\nIn addition,  no more than 3 credit hours may be counted simultaneously toward both the environmental and\nsustainability studies minor and any other major or minor. Topics courses may count toward the minor with approval\nof the director.\n \nA.

The program provides a strong engineering background centered on digital\ntechnology combined with an understanding of the principles and techniques of computer science. Computer\nengineering is design-oriented. The basic principles of engineering and computer science are applied to the task at\nhand, which may be the design of a digital processor, processor peripheral, or a complete digital processor-based\nPage 340 of 1019\nsystem.\n \nWhatever the undertaking, the comprehensive academic training in this program enables engineers to evaluate the\nimpact of their decisions, whether working with hardware, software, or the interface between the two.\n \nThe computer engineering program combines fundamental core requirements with flexibility to allow students to\nspecialize in a variety of emphasis areas within the program. The curriculum includes requirements in the basic\nsciences, mathematics, and humanities; a primary core of hardware and software courses; and a set of electives\nthat combine breadth and depth requirements as described below. Students who major in computer engineering\nwho wish to apply for graduate study in electrical engineering or computer science are encouraged strongly to\nselect their elective courses to demonstrate depth in that particular area; the structure of the program enables that\noption. The course of study leads to a bachelor of engineering.\n \nUndergraduate Honors Program. With faculty approval, junior and senior students may be accepted into the Honors\nProgram. To achieve honors status, the student must:\n1. achieve and maintain a minimum GPA of 3.5.\n2. complete 3 hours of undergraduate research (ECE 3860, 3861 or CS 3860, 3861) with final written report\n3. complete 6 hours of ECE program elective credit from the following list:\na. up to 3 additional hours of undergraduate research (ECE 3860, 3861 or CS 3860, 3861), or\nb. design domain expertise (DE) courses beyond the one course required by the program, or\nc.

Emphasis is on\ncomputing activities of both practical and intellectual interest, and on theoretical studies of efficient algorithms and\nthe limits of computation. Computer facilities are available for class assignments, team projects, and individual\nstudies.\n \nStudents are challenged to seek original insights throughout their study. Working in teams, participating in summer\ninternships, supporting student professional organizations, and developing interdisciplinary projects are strongly\nencouraged.\nThe computer science major provides an excellent back- ground for medical studies, and the flexibility provided by\nits many open electives allows students to prepare for medical school while earning a degree in computer science\nwith a normal load in four years. Interested students should discuss their plans with their computer science adviser\nin the fall of their first year.\n \nIn addition to the bachelor of science, the master of science and doctor of philosophy are also awarded in computer\nscience. Computer Science majors in the School of Engineering are encouraged to consider a double major or minor\nto complement their CS studies. Popular double majors include Mathematics, Economics, HOD and Physics. The\nsecond major in Computer Science is accessible to students outside of the School of Engineering. Second major\nrequirements can be found following the engineering specimen curriculum below.\n \nUndergraduate Honors. Honors in Computer Science provides recognition for select undergraduates who have\nexperienced advanced study in computer science. Students who have an overall GPA of 3.5 or better, a GPA of 3.5\nor better in computer science classes, and six hours of any combination of undergraduate research (CS 3860, 3861,\nand 3862) and courses at or above the 6000-level will be granted honors in the computer science program.

Ornes\n \nCOURSES OFFERED: CSET\n \nThe Program in Communication of Science and Technology (CSET) sits at the intersection of the sciences and the\nhumanities, and it builds on the vast amount of effort at Vanderbilt devoted to interdisciplinary work that spans the\nnatural sciences, engineering, the social sciences, and the humanities. CSET draws on both the scientific\ncommunities (natural sciences, social sciences, engineering, medicine) and the creative communities (public\nspeaking, writing, digital media production) across multiple colleges at Vanderbilt.\n \nCSET is designed for students who have an interest in science and technology and also are interested in\ncommunicating science and technology to both peer-professional audiences and to the larger world. CSET is ideal as\na second major for students pursuing a first major in one of the natural sciences, any of several of the social\nsciences, engineering, the Science, Medicine and Technology concentration in History, and the Creative Writing track\nin English. In the twenty-first century scientists must be able to communicate their work and their ideas to their\nprofessional peers, to nonspecialists who review grant proposals, and to lay audiences who ultimately fund,\nsupport, and benefit from the discoveries made in laboratories around the world. In return, the scientific community\nneeds support from professional writers, journalists, technical writing specialists, public speakers, film and video\nwriters and producers, and bloggers in communicating modern science, technology, and medicine to lay audiences.\nProgram of Concentration in Communication of Science and Technology\nTrack 1: Standard track [at least 42 credit hours] \n1.

Morgan\nSenior Lecturer: Ann Klyce\n \nCOURSES OFFERED: EES\n \nThe Earth and environmental sciences are aimed at understanding Earth\u2019s governing processes\u2014how they operate\nand interact\u2014as well as interpreting Earth\u2019s dynamic history\u2014its age and origin as recorded in rocks and the\nlandscape\u2014 and finally, at understanding how geological processes affect modern environmental and ecological\nsystems, including humans. Among the natural sciences, ours is the quintessential interdisciplinary science,\nproviding vital perspective on how Earth\u2019s physical and geochemical template simultaneously sustains and\nthreatens life, and influences human interactions with Earth.\n \nThe Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences (EES) offers an integrated Earth and Environmental Sciences\nundergraduate major leading to the B.A. degree. Students majoring in EES take a core set of science courses with\nlab, computational, and field components, design an academic plan that allows them to develop expertise in an\narea of interest within EES. The comparatively small size of the faculty and student body allows many opportunities\nfor faculty-student interaction. Students use the major as preparation for graduate study, for careers in\nenvironmental and climate science, geology, and natural resource and energy management, and for related fields\nsuch as land use planning, teaching, conservation, business, law, or engineering.\n \nResearch programs in the department, which in many cases involve students, employ field, analytical, and\nexperimental methods. A wide variety of Earth processes are investigated, ranging from the migration of fluids and\ngeneration of magmas in the Earth\u2019s crust, to the movement of mass and energy across land, ocean, and\natmosphere, to the evolution of life and ecosystems, to the impacts of humans on the environment. Study areas, in\naddition to Tennessee, include the southwestern United States, the Pacific northwest, Florida, Colorado, Antarctica,\nSouth Asia, Brazil, Italy, Greenland, Peru, Namibia, the Bahamas, Australia, and New Zealand.\n \nProgram of Concentration in Earth and Environmental Sciences\nThe Department of Earth and Environmental Sciences offers two tracks to an EES major, to support the preparation\nof future scientists and students aimed at science-related pursuits. Both tracks provide a solid grounding in the\nintegrated Earth and environmental sciences while allowing flexibility in the particular focus and support\ncommunication, quantitative, and computational skills.\nTrack 1\nThis track is designed for students who aim to build a strong, integrated earth and environmental science foundation\nto inform discussions and work in policy, education, law, advocacy, community engagement, conservation, finance,\netc. but do not aim to work as practicing scientists. This pathway pairs well with programs in Climate and\nEnvironmental Studies, Environmental Sociology, Communication of Science and Technology, Secondary Education,\nand other non-STEM majors that, together, will prepare students for the interdisciplinary nature of addressing the\nEarth and environmental challenges of our future.\n \nTrack 1 of the EES major is organized into six parts, beginning with two of three introductory courses that serve as\nentry points. The second part involves a core course that provides all EES majors with a common background in\nways of thinking in Earth and environmental sciences. This core course must be completed before students may\nenroll in  more advanced EES courses. As Earth and Environmental sciences employ techniques and foundational\nknowledge from all other STEM fields, part 3 of the major builds skills in supporting STEM fields through three\nclasses: one in scientific computing, one in statistics, and one additional supporting science elective.\n \nPage 359 of 1019\nThe fourth part of the major defines a focus for the student through both experiential and seminar-style EES courses.\nThe fifth component addresses science communication skills with one course.  The sixth component of the major is a\n1 credit hour seminar that serves as a capstone for senior students. In addition to the major, qualified Track 1\nstudents may elect to participate in the Honors Program designed for highly motivated students who want to pursue\nresearch as undergraduates. Opportunities for research may be available to other students outside of the Honors\nProgram.\n \nAt least 36 credit hours toward the major are required as follows:\n \n1. EES Foundations (3+1 credit hours each): Two introductory courses, one with lab, from\n1510/1510L, 1030/1030L, and/or 1081/1081L\n7\n2. EES Core (4 credit hours): 2510, \nRequired as prerequisite for nearly all upper level EES courses\n4\n3. STEM Foundation (3 credit hours each): \nOne course in scientific computing: CS 1101 or DS 1101\nOne course in statistics: MATH 1011, DS 2100, BSCI 3270, ECON 1500 or 1510, MATH 218,\n2820, or 2821, SOC 2100\nOne additional supporting science: any additional course from ASTR, BSCI, CHEM, MATH,\nPHYS, CS, DS excluding courses numbered 1111 and excluding BSCI 1400. Other courses from\nthe School of Engineering may be considered with permission of the DUS\n9\n4. EES Focus (1-4 credit hours each):\nAt least five classes and at least 15 hours, chosen from any EES course numbered 2050 or\nabove 3000. Must include at least two courses at the 4000 level. At least eight hours in this\ncategory must be experiential, from the following: lab courses (EES 3220, 3260, 3280, 3310,\n3330, 3340), field-based courses (EES 3865 [3-4 credit hours or 1 credit hour attached to\nanother regular EES course with permission]), EES 3875, or an include up to three credit hours\nof research or internships (EES 3841, 3842, 3881, 4998, 4999)\n15-17\n5. Earth Science Communication (0-3 credit hours): Any CSET course, any writing-intensive\n(W) course from EES, BSCI, CHEM, PHYS, or one course from the following: EES 3875, 4233,\n4680, 4996+4997, SCED 2330\n0-3\n6. Senior Seminar: 4961\n1\n \n \nTotal hours:\n36-41\nTrack 2\nThis track is designed to prepare students for careers as earth and environmental scientists, including entering the\nscience workforce after graduation and/or pursuing postgraduate academic work.\n \nGiven the broad and interdisciplinary nature of EES, it is important that students design an academic plan in\nconsultation with their adviser and referencing the EES Disciplinary Pathway documents, to ensure appropriate\npreparation for their area of interest. Preparing to be competitive for graduate programs may include additional\ncoursework beyond the major requirements, particularly advanced math, computing, chemistry, biosciences, or\nphysics, depending on disciplinary interest. Students on this pathway are encouraged to pursue research\nparticularly if aimed at post-graduate academic work.\n \nNote that prerequisite STEM courses (CHEM 1601, PHYS 1501/1601, MATH 1100/1201/1301) may be taken on an\nungraded basis for students above the freshman level, but working knowledge of the course content will be required\nPage 360 of 1019\nin upper-level EES and other STEM courses.\n \nStudents who are interested in pursuing minor and/or double majors in other STEM fields should discuss options\nwith the DUS as some coursework in other departments may replace EES coursework if part of an intentionally\ndesigned plan made in consultation with the adviser and DUS.\n \nTrack 2 is organized into six parts, beginning with one of three introductory courses that serve as an entry point. The\nsecond part involves three core courses that provide all Track 2 majors with a common background in methods and\nways of thinking in Earth and environmental sciences. At least one EES core course must be completed before\nstudents may enroll in more advanced focus courses of part four. Specific core courses may be prerequisite for\nrelated upper-level electives, and so students are encouraged to take these early in their academic career. As Earth\nand Environmental sciences employ techniques and foundational knowledge from all other STEM fields, courses in\npart 2 and part 4 of the major have outside STEM courses as prerequisites and part 3 of the major rquires students to\nbuild additional skills in supporting STEM fields through two more STEM electives: one of which must be quantitative\nor computational.\n \nThe fourth part of the major defines a focus for the student through both experiential and seminar-style EES courses.\nThe fifth component addresses science communication skills with one course.  The sixth component of the major is a\n1 credit hour seminar that serves as a capstone for senior students. Track 2 students are strongly encouraged to\npursue research. Highly motivated and successful students may elect to participate in the EES Honors Program.\n \nAt least 37 credit hours toward the major are required as follows:\n \n1. EES Foundations (3+1 credit hours each): One introductory course with lab, from\n1510/1510L, 1030/1030L, and/or 1081/1081L\n4\n2. EES Core (4 credit hours): 2510, 2550, and one course in physical dynamics from the\nfollowing list: EES 2580, 4420, 4550, 4650. Note that all EES physical-dynamic focused\ncourses have MATH 110/1201/1301 and PHYS 1501/1601/1911 as prerequisite and that CHEM\n1601 is corequisite for EES 2550.\nRequired as prerequisite for nearly all upper level EES courses\n11\n3. STEM Electives (3 credit hours each): \nTwo courses from the following: CHEM 1602 or higher; PHYS 1502/1602, 1912 or higher, MATH\n2300 or higher, BSCI 1510 or higher, ASTR 2110 or higher, CS 1101 or higher, DS 1101 or\nhigher. One of these must be quantitative or computational, e.g. from MATH, CS, DS, or intro\nstatistics (BSCI 3270).\nOther courses from the School of Engineering may be considered with permission of the DUS\n6\n4. EES Focus (1-4 credit hours each):\nAt least five classes and at least 15 hours, chosen from any EES course numbered 2050 or\nabove 3000. Must include at least two courses at the 4000 level. At least eight hours in this\ncategory must be experiential, from the following: lab courses (EES 3220, 3260, 3280, 3310,\n3330, 3340), field-based courses (EES 3865 [3-4 credit hours or 1 credit hour attached to\nanother regular EES course with permission]), EES 3875, or an include up to three credit hours\nof research or internships (EES 3841, 3842, 3881, 4998, 4999)\n15-17\n5. Earth Science Communication (0-3 credit hours): Any CSET course, any writing-intensive\n(W) course from EES, BSCI, CHEM, PHYS, or one course from the following: EES 3875, 4233,\n4680, 4996+4997, SCED 2330\n0-3\n6. Senior Seminar: 4961\n1\n \n \nTotal hours:\n37-42\nPage 361 of 1019\nDesigning Area of Focus\nIn-depth Earth and Environmental Sciences courses can be chosen to define a focus area within EES. Students\nshould consult with their major adviser and follow guidance documents posted on the departmental website to\nchoose a focus area and associated course options. All parts of the Earth and its environments are interconnected,\nand the integrated Earth and Environmental Science major allows students to create a comprehensive\nunderstanding of the cycling of energy and materials through Earth\u2019s four spheres (lithosphere, hydrosphere,\natmosphere, and biosphere) while also developing some more specific expertise through a focus.  \nHonors in Earth and Environmental Sciences\nThe EES Honors Program provides research experience and mentoring in preparation for a career or graduate\nstudies in Earth and environmental sciences. Interested students should apply to the undergraduate adviser for\nentry into the Honors Program fall semester, junior year. A grade point average of 3.3 or higher both cumulatively\nand in courses that count toward the EES major is required for admission to the Honors Program.\nWorking closely with a faculty adviser, students in the Honors Program complete a research project of interest to\nboth the student and faculty member during the junior and senior years. In order to graduate with honors in EES, a\nstudent must: (1) maintain a 3.3 grade point average both in the EES major and cumulatively; (2) complete the\nrequired courses for the EES major; (3) complete Senior Honors Seminar (4996, 4997) and Senior Honors Research\n(4998, 4999); (4) satisfactorily present the results of his/her research in written form as a senior thesis to two\nmembers of the faculty and orally to students and faculty of the department.\n \nMinor in Earth and Environmental Sciences\nThe minor in EES provides students with a broad background in Earth processes, systems, and history, and an\nintroduction to environmental issues. This background is highly relevant to many different fields of endeavor. The\nminor does not fully prepare students for graduate studies or employment as Earth or environmental scientists,\nthough it could do so paired with another relevant STEM major. Students should consult with the director of\nundergraduate studies about how the minor in EES fits with their career or graduate school interests.\n \nThe minor consists of at least five courses (at least 17 credit hours; EES 1510/1510L, 1030/1030L, and EES\n1081/1081L each count as one course). Students are encouraged to choose courses based on their interests and\ncareer plans and to discuss course selection with the director of undergraduate studies. No more than two 1000-\nlevel courses count toward the minor. Two courses with labs are required; one must be numbered above 2000. No\ncredit toward the minor is given for EES 3841\u20133842 or 3851\u20133852.\n \nLicensure for Teaching\nEES majors may choose a second major in science education which includes teaching licensure, a prudent choice if\ninterested in teaching. Peabody offers a fifth-year master\u2019s program for science majors interested in teaching. Upon\ngraduating with a B.A. in EES, EES majors in the fifth-year program would spend the next summer and academic\nyear earning their M.Ed. and teaching licensure.\n \nStudents seeking teacher certification in science disciplines at the secondary level should refer to the chapter on\nCertification for Teaching in the Peabody College section of the Undergraduate Catalog.

This program is designed for highly motivated students interested in\ndoing independent research. Students who meet the College of Arts and Science\u2019s requirements for honors\ncandidacy as set forth elsewhere in this catalog should consult the director of undergraduate studies no later than\nthe fall term of their junior year. Honors candidates must complete 36 credit hours in economics, including the 18\ncredit hours of courses required of all economics majors. Honors candidates should complete 3032 or 3035 before\nsenior year. In addition, the Honors Program requires completion of (1) Economics 3698 Junior Honors Research (1\ncredit hour), (2) Economics 3851\u20133852 Senior Thesis (6 credit hours), culminating in a written thesis, (3) Economics\n4981\u20134982 Honors Seminar (2 credit hours), (4) 9 credit hours of electives including at least 6 credit hours in\nEconomics courses above 3035. Honors candidates are required to write a senior thesis and to defend it in an oral\nexamination. On satisfactory completion of this program, a student will graduate with honors or with highest honors\nin economics.\nProgram of Concentration in Economics and History\nThis is an interdisciplinary program split between Economics and History that provides a more focused program of\nstudy while requiring fewer credit hours than a double major in the two fields. The program consists of 45 credit\nhours of course work of which 9 credit hours are from a common economic history core and the remaining 36 credit\nhours are evenly divided between Economics and History. Students are expected to observe course-specific\nrequirements in each department. The details are spelled out below under Economics and History.\nLicensure for Teaching\nCandidates for teacher licensure in economics at the secondary level should refer to the chapter on Licensure for\nTeaching in the Peabody College section of this catalog.\nEconomics and History\nThe joint major in economics and history makes an important contribution to liberal education at Vanderbilt by\nhelping students understand the origins and organization of modern society. It also provides a unique preparation for\ncareers in business, the professions, and other fields by combining all the analytical tools of the regular economics\nmajor with history\u2019s emphasis on clear and effective writing and on developing skills in gathering, assessing, and\nsynthesizing information. The program consists of 45 credit hours of course work: 9 credit hours in an economic\nhistory core, and an additional 18 credit hours in economics and 18 in history. Students declare their major through\nthe Department of History office.\n \nNote: One semester of calculus is a prerequisite for ECON 1500 and 1510. MATH 1201 (or MATH 1301) is a\nprerequisite for Economics courses numbered 3000 and above.\n \nThe description of the Concentration in Economics and History below will apply to students who\nmatriculate at Vanderbilt in August 2018 and thereafter.\n \nPage 364 of 1019\nCourse work for the major is distributed as follows:\n \nEconomic History Core (9 credit hours)\nThree of the following courses, one of which must be an economics course above 3000:\n \nHIST 1039, 1352, 1600, 1640, 1660, 1665, 2106, 2107, 2138, 2150, 2255, 2660, 2700, 2710, 3190, 3200, ECON\n2150, 3150, 3160, RUSS 2810.\n \nNote: ECON 3012 is a prerequisite for ECON 3150, and 3160.\n \nEconomics (18 credit hours)\nECON 1010, 1020, 1500 or 1510, 3012, 3022; one ECON course above 3022 not included in the economic history\ncore.\n \nNote: The following course sequences may be substituted for ECON 1500 or 1510: Option 1: MATH 2810, 2820L, and\neither ECON 3032 or 3035.\nOption 2: MATH 2820, 2820L, and either ECON 3032 or 3035. In these cases, ECON 3032 or 3035 will also count as\nan elective.\n \nHistory (18 credit hours)\nNo more than 3 credit hours of AP or IB credit in history courses may count toward this total.\n1. History 3000W or 3980; must be taken by the end of the junior year. 3980 is limited to second-semester\njuniors who have been admitted to the Honors Program. Students entering the Honors Program who have\nalready earned credit for 3000W will receive elective credit for that course.\n2. History 4960 (prerequisite: History 3000W), or History 4980\u20134981 (available only to students in the Honors\nProgram). Note: At the discretion of the director of honors and the director of undergraduate studies in\nhistory, a student who has earned credit for 4980 but does not take 4981 may be considered to have fulfilled\nthe capstone requirement for the major.\n3. Four other history courses. Electives may include any courses, not used to satisfy any of the above\nrequirements, offered by the Department of History, including any courses listed for the history major.\nHonors Program (9 more credit hours)\nStudents apply to the Honors Program in History in the first semester of the junior year.\n \n54 credit hours: students will take the four-course honors sequence, HIST 3980, 4980\u20134981, 4999. Because HIST\n4980\u20134981 satisfies the capstone requirement, honors students will not be required to take HIST 4960, though they\nmay enroll for 4960 as an elective. Students will write an interdisciplinary thesis under the direction of an adviser\nfrom each department.\nElectrical and Computer Engineering\nUndergraduate Honors Program\nFacilities\nCurriculum Requirements\nElectrical and Computer Engineering Areas of Concentration\nPage 365 of 1019\nSpecimen Curriculum for Electrical and Computer Engineering\nMinor in Electrical and Computer Engineering\n \n \nINTERIM CHAIR Benoit M.

Caleb Clanton\n \nThe Division of Engineering Science and Management administers the engineering science major, the engineering\nmanagement minor, and the first-year introduction to engineering course. The division oversees non-traditional\nengineering study and advises students on course selection to meet specific career goals that traditional\nengineering majors may not provide.\n \nCOURSES OFFERED: ENGM, ES\nEngineering Science Major (Bachelor of Science)\nThe engineering science major is flexible and interdisciplinary\u2014offering students the opportunity to select a program\nof study to meet special interests or objectives. Many students choose a program of study in engineering\nmanagement, communication of science and technology, various engineering concentrations, environmental\nscience or materials  science; however, students may develop unique plans of study to specialize in areas for which\nfacilities and faculty competence exist but which are not covered within a single existing degree program at\nVanderbilt. Engineering science graduates may establish careers in engineering or science, interface with engineers\n(e.g., in marketing and sales), or use their analytical and problem-solving skills to build future professional careers.\nDefined areas of concentration exist in engineering management, communication of science and technology,\nsecondary education, and materials science and engineering. Individual programs have been developed for students\ninterested in careers in engineering mathematics, environmental engineering, transportation engineering, teaching,\ntechnical communications, and other areas requiring nontraditional combinations of engineering courses. Because\nof the flexible nature of the engineering science programs of study, accreditation has not been sought for these\nprograms of study, and engineering science majors will not qualify for engineering licensure in most states.\n \nEngineering Management. Engineering management is an interdisciplinary program of study designed to give\nstudents the tools to manage technology development and innovation, to enhance manufacturing quality and\nproductivity in a competitive international environment, and to implement these objectives successfully in an\nPage 372 of 1019\norganization. Engineering management links engineering, science, and the management disciplines. In addition to\nthe core science and math courses required of all engineering students, topics of study include entrepreneurship,\nhuman resources management, finance in technology-based organizations, technology strategy, communications,\nand operations.\n \nCommunication of Science and Technology. Many careers that are attractive to graduates of the engineering science\nprogram require the communication of engineering and science to people who are not technically trained. The\nCommunication of Science and Technology interdisciplinary program prepares engineering students for careers in\nareas such as technical consulting, high-technology marketing and sales, environmental law, and journalism. The\nprogram combines traditional engineering and science courses with communications and humanities courses in a\nflexible curriculum. Engineering science majors may select from a set of program electives identified by the faculty\ncommittee of the School of Engineering and the College of Arts and Science that supervises the program.\n \nMinors. Students may also pursue a minor consisting of at least five courses of at least three credit hours within a\nrecognized area of knowledge. Minors are offered in engineering management, materials science and engineering,\ncomputer engineering, electrical engineering, computer science, scientific computing, environmental engineering,\nenergy and environmental systems, nanoscience and nanotechnology, and most disciplines within the College of\nArts and Science. Students must declare their intention to pursue minors by completing forms available in the Office\nof Academic Services of the School of Engineering.\nCurriculum Requirements\nThe B.S. in engineering science requires a minimum of 122 hours, distributed as follows:\n1.

Senior Capstone (5 hours): ES 4950, 4951, 4959.\n4. Liberal Arts Core (18 hours). To be selected to fulfill the Liberal Arts Core requirements listed in the Degree\nPrograms in Engineering.\n5. Open Electives (6 hours).\n6. Program Concentration (24 hours). In consultation with the academic adviser, each student must identify a\nmeaningful sequence of courses, not counting certain introductory-level courses, that directly contributes to\nmeeting stated career goals. Program concentrations are approved by the academic adviser and the program\ndirector in advance and become part of the student\u2019s degree audit.\nThe preparation provided by the program concentration, together with a solid foundation in basic engineering\ncourses, provides the engineering science student a strong and useful career base.\n \nNo more than 24 credit hours of business-related course work (BUS, BUSA, ENGM, FNEC, MGRL) may be applied to\nthe ES degree program. Only one business-related minor (BUS, ENGM, FNEC, MGRL, HOD) may count to a student\u2019s\nacademic program. No more than 6 credit hours of courses numbered 3840 to 3879 in any program may be applied\nto the ES degree program.\n \nUndergraduates in engineering science may apply the pass/ fail option only to courses taken as liberal arts core or\nopen electives, subject to the school requirements for pass/fail. UNIV courses are eligible for open elective credit\nonly. Credit for the senior capstone sequence (4 hours) satisfies the Immersion Vanderbilt requirement.\nPage 373 of 1019\nEnglish\nProgram of Concentration in English and American Literature\nMinor in English: Literature\nMinor in English: Creative Writing\nGeneral Requirements and Advice for Majors and Minors in All Programs\nHonors Program\nLicensure for Teaching\n \n \nCHAIR Jennifer Fay\nDIRECTOR OF UNDERGRADUATE STUDIES Mark Schoenfield\nDIRECTOR OF GRADUATE STUDIES Candice Amich\nProfessors, Emeriti: Kate Daniels, Joan Dayan, Lynn Enterline, Lorraine L\u00f3pez, Leah Marcus, Hortense Spillers,\nCecelia Tichi, Houston Baker, W.

The curriculum includes analysis and design courses in environmental\nengineering. Vanderbilt\u2019s B.E. in environmental engineering prepares students for entry-level positions in many\nspecialty areas of environmental engineering, as well as a variety of other careers, such as business, government,\nand law. The major will provide students with the tools necessary to develop effective solutions to solve emerging\nand existing issues such as water resources, quality, and treatment; aging infrastructures; climate change and\ncarbon neutral innovations; energy and material resources; wastes and pollution; and other environmental\nchallenges. Recognizing that environmental solutions cannot be realized without consideration of social, cultural,\neconomic, and political factors, students will be required to extend the breadth of their studies with courses in data\nscience and global perspectives courses in social sciences, economics, political sciences, and the humanities.  These\nwill be in addition to foundational courses in the basic and applied sciences, mathematics, engineering, and\nadvanced courses in fate, transport, and treatment of contaminants in the environment. The curriculum culminates\nwith a senior design project in which students will have the opportunity to draw on and integrate the broad\nknowledge they have gained from the data science and global perspectives courses with the science and\nengineering knowledge they gained in the major. Due to the complex interdisciplinary nature of the field, many\nundergraduate students continue their environmental engineering education and earn either a professional (MEng)\ndegree or a graduate (MS or PhD) degree. \n \nUndergraduate Honors Program. The Honors Program in environmental engineering provides an opportunity for\nselected students to develop individually through independent study and research. The environmental engineering\nhonors program requires a minimum overall GPA of 3.5. Acceptance to the program is made by petition to the\nfaculty during the junior year. Transfer students may be considered for admission after completing one semester at\nVanderbilt. Candidates for honors choose their technical courses with the consent of a faculty honors adviser. A\nthree-credit hour independent study course and a summer research internship with a final report and presentation\ngiven in the spring semester of the senior year to the ENVE faculty and students are required. The independent\nstudy course may also be counted towards the environmental engineering technical electives. The diploma\ndesignation is Honors in Environmental Engineering.\n \nFacilities: The environmental laboratories are fully supplied with modern instrumentation for chemical, physical,\nbiological, and radiological analysis of soils, sediments, water, wastewater, air, and solid waste. They include\nequipment for the study of biological waste treatment, physical-chemical waste treatment, contaminant mass\ntransfer, and state-of-the-art instrumentation.   All are available for student use in courses, demonstrations, and\nresearch. \n \nUndergraduates in environmental engineering may apply the pass/fail option only to courses taken as open or\nliberal arts core electives, subject to the school requirements for pass/fail.\n \nA double major in Environmental Engineering and Chemical Engineering is offered as a unitary ChE-ENVE curriculum,\nwhich is described in the Chemical Engineering section of the catalog under its curriculum requirements. It requires\na minimum of 137 semester hours. Undergraduates in the double major may apply the pass/fail option only to\ncourses taken as open electives, subject to the school requirements for pass/fail.\nCurriculum requirements\nThe B.E. in environmental engineering will require a minimum of 121 hours, distributed as follows:\n1.

Electives (6\u201312 credit hours, depending on the nature of the capstone course)\n \nProgram of Concentration in Law, History, and Society\nAs a human institution self-consciously aware of its past, \u201cThe Law\u201d raises a complex set of issues that can be\naddressed historically. Legislation and jurisprudence, for example, allow historians a privileged perspective into how\nsocieties sought to define themselves, their values, and their membership. Constitutions provide maps of political\npower, and serve as sites of struggle over goods both real and symbolic. Records of legal practice are often well\npreserved, allowing access to the voices and actions of people who are usually left out of systems of political\norganization.\n \nThis major approaches law from both a historical and an interdisciplinary perspective. Emphasis will be placed on\nclose reading of legal documents, research in legal archives, and analytical writing. Students will be encouraged to\ndevelop reading programs and research topics that stretch across national and chronological boundaries, and to\nthink comparatively. Students may not major both in history and in law, history, and society. Students majoring in\nlaw, history, and society may apply to receive honors through the History Honors Program.\n \nThe major program requires a minimum of 30 credit hours in history; no more than 3 credit hours of AP or IB credit\nmay count toward this total. Note: AP and IB credit will not count toward the 15 credit hours for the concentration.\nNo more than 6 credit hours may be from courses outside the Department of History.\n \nCourse work is distributed as follows:\n \n1. History Workshop. 3000W or 3980 (3 credit hours)\nNote: 3000W is a prerequisite for the 4960 capstone course. 3980 is limited to second-semester juniors who have\nbeen admitted to the Honors Program.

It offers superior undergraduate history majors\na program of advanced reading, research, and writing. The Honors Program combines seminar work and\nindependent study under the supervision of a thesis adviser. This structure provides participants an introduction to\nhistorical research and writing, as well as the opportunity to study defined areas of history and significant historical\nproblems that accord with their own interests. The final objectives of the Honors Program are successful authorship\nof the honors thesis and graduation with honors or highest honors in the major.\n \nStudents apply to the Honors Program in the first semester of the junior year. Students meeting college and\ndepartmental requirements will enroll for a total of 12 credit hours: History 3980, Junior Honors Seminar in History (3\ncredit hours); History 4980\u20134981 Senior Honors Research Seminar (6 credit hours); and 4999, Senior Honors Thesis\n(3 credit hours). In addition, the Honors Program requires an oral defense of the honors thesis before a faculty\ncommittee at the end of the third semester.\n \nProgram of Concentration in Economics and History\nThis is an interdisciplinary program split between economics and history that provides a more focused program of\nstudy while requiring fewer credit hours than a double major in the two fields.

Many students will use the program in history of art\nand architecture as a foundation for careers in which analytical reading and writing skills gained in the major are\nespecially valued: as the basis for advanced training in professional schools (such as architecture, law, medicine,\njournalism, and business), for postgraduate work in history of art or architecture, and for employment in galleries,\nmuseums, or design-related fields. The department helps students become readers of visual images and material\nculture throughout their lives, and encourages visual approaches to learning. In addition, the department provides\npractical experience in research, writing, and exhibition organization that are key to pursuing museum and gallery\ncareers, as well as courses in museum studies.\n \nMajors in history of art and architecture participate in the activities of the Vanderbilt History of Art Society, the\nstudent architecture group, and work closely with departmental advisers. The History of Art Society and the\ndepartment sponsor events such as panels, lectures, debates, and other programs where majors meet and engage\nin discussions with historians of art and museum curators.\n \nThe department curriculum complements those of related departments and programs, including African American\nand Diaspora Studies, American Studies, Anthropology, Asian Studies, Cinema and Media Arts, Classical and\nMediterranean Studies, European Studies, Gender and Sexuality Studies, Latin American, Caribbean, and Latinx\nStudies, and Religious Studies.\n \nPage 401 of 1019\nThe Department of History of Art and Architecture offers a major and minor in history of art, and a major and minor\nin architecture and the built environment.\nProgram of Concentration in History of Art\nThe history of art major requires 30 credit hours and gives students the opportunity to study art and visual culture\nacross a wide range of historical periods, from ancient to contemporary. The program is designed to allow for\nconcentration in particular periods and areas of interest. By requiring courses in both the lecture and seminar\nformat, the program aims to provide a basis of comprehensive knowledge and challenging opportunities for more\nspecialized instruction.\n \nStudents should consider related offerings in cognate disciplines in the humanities and social sciences. Those\nplanning graduate work in history of art should pursue advanced studies\u2014which may include honors\u2014and take\nadvanced courses in other departments offering complementary course work. Advanced language studies are\nstrongly recommended, as graduate programs expect reading facility in one language for the M.A. and two for the\nPh.D., with French and German the most commonly required. Non-European languages should be considered for\nthose primarily interested in global traditions.\n \nCourse work is distributed as follows:\nA 1000-level course (3 credit hours): Students must complete one 1000-level survey course in history of art\nor architecture selected from HART 1100, 1105, 1120, 1121, 1122, 1200, 1205, 1220, 1300, or 1400.

The minor is administered by the School of Engineering.\n \nNanoscience and nanotechnology are based on the ability to synthesize, organize, characterize, and manipulate\nmatter systematically at dimensions of ~1 to 100 nm, creating uniquely functional materials that differ in properties\nfrom those prepared by traditional approaches. At these length scales, materials can take on new properties that\ncan be exploited in a wide range of applications such as for solar energy conversion, ultra-sensitive sensing, and\nnew types of vaccines. These activities require the integration of expertise from various areas of science and\nengineering, often relying on methods of synthesis, fabrication, and characterization that are beyond those\nPage 435 of 1019\nencountered in an individual course of study.\n \nStudents who minor in nanoscience and nanotechnology learn the principles and methods used in this rapidly\ngrowing field. Its core originates in the physical sciences by providing key approaches for describing the behavior of\nmatter on the nanoscale. Synthetic approaches are used to manipulate matter systematically, for creating uniquely\nfunctional nanomaterials that can be inorganic, organic, biological, or a hybrid of these. With a third component of\ncharacterization, a process for designing systems to have particular properties as a result of their composition and\nnanoscale arrangement emerges. Students are introduced to these areas through foundational and elective courses\nfor the minor that are specified below, the latter of which can be selected to fulfill the degree requirements for their\nmajor.\n \nThe minor in nanoscience and nanotechnology is supported by the Vanderbilt Institute of Nanoscale Science and\nEngineering (VINSE) that brings together faculty from the College of Arts and Science, the School of Engineering,\nand the Medical Center. A specialized laboratory facility maintained by VINSE provides students in the minor with\ncapstone experiences that allow them to prepare and characterize a variety of nanostructured systems using in-\nhouse state-of-the-art instrumentation. This hands-on laboratory component enhances the attractiveness of\nstudents to both employers and graduate schools.\nNanoscience and Nanotechnology Minor\nThe minor in nanoscience and nanotechnology requires a total of 15 credit hours, distributed as follows:\n \n1. Nano Core (6 hours). NANO 3000 and one of CHEM 2610 or CHBE 4840 or PHYS 2660.\n2.

To meet the challenge of providing training for entry into this exciting and growing field, Vanderbilt\noffers an interdisciplinary program of concentration in neuroscience that utilizes expertise from several departments\nwithin  the university. The program consists of three components. The first provides for a broad foundation in the\nbasic sciences and mathematics. Second, the program provides for exposure to each of the general areas of\nneuroscience including courses in cellular/molecular, systems, and integrative/cognitive neuroscience. This course\nwork is supplemented with exposure to the laboratory techniques utilized in neuroscience research. Finally, the\nprogram allows students to pursue more work in the specific sub-disciplines of neuroscience and in areas of inquiry\nrelated to neuroscience through elective courses. Students are especially encouraged to participate in research in\nthe laboratories of neuroscience faculty under the auspices of the undergraduate research courses. More extensive\nresearch experience  is available through the Honors Program in Neuroscience. For additional information, see\nas.vanderbilt.edu/neuroscience.\nProgram of Concentration\nThe neuroscience major consists of 38 credit hours of course work that includes 8 credit hours of organic chemistry\nand 30 credit hours of neuroscience and related courses distributed among specific disciplines associated with the\nstudy of neuroscience. Students majoring in neuroscience are additionally required to complete a core of\nintroductory courses in mathematics, statistics or computer science, biology and physics that provide the broad\nscientific background necessary to the study of neuroscience.

The following distribution\nof courses is required as part of the major. Logic: 1003 or 3003 (at least 3 credit hours); Ethics: 1005, 3605, 3606, or\n3606W (at least 3 credit hours); History of Philosophy: 2100, 2101, 2102, 2103, or 2104 (at least 6 credit hours). Any\nalterations must be approved by the director of undergraduate studies. We encourage all majors to work closely\nwith their advisers to select courses that form a coherent whole. The student must take at least 30 credit hours in\nthe major field of which at least 21 credit hours must be in courses beyond the 1000 level.\n \nHonors Program\nThe Honors Program offers opportunities for advanced study in philosophy, including independent research projects\nand/or enrollment in certain graduate seminars (with permission of the instructor). To be admitted to the program,\nthe student must: (a) be a major in philosophy; (b) have a grade point average of 3.3 in all courses; (c) have a 3.5\ngrade point average in philosophy courses; and (d) develop a written proposal for advanced study in consultation\nwith a philosophy faculty sponsor. Students who satisfy these requirements should meet with the director of\nundergraduate studies to review their programs, whereupon the director may nominate the students for honors\nwork. Honors work typically begins in the junior year or in the first semester of the senior year; students in the\nprogram must complete at least 3 credit hours of Philosophy 3999. Students who successfully complete the program\nwhile maintaining the grade point averages of 3.3 generally, and 3.5 in the major, will receive honors in philosophy;\nstudents who do especially distinguished work will receive highest honors.\n \nMinor in Philosophy\nThe minor in philosophy consists of 18 credit hours, including at least 12 credit hours in courses beyond the 1000\nlevel. The minor program will be constructed so as to provide a broad grounding in philosophy and to complement\nthe student\u2019s other studies. Each program must be approved by the director of undergraduate studies.\n \nNote: 1002 or 1002W or 1005 or 1111 are ordinarily taken prior to all other philosophy courses, except 1003 and\n3003 (logic courses), 3616 (philosophy of science), and 3013 (aesthetics).\nPhysics and Astronomy\nProgram of Concentration in Physics\nLicensure for Teaching\nHonors Program\nDepartmental Minors\nMinor in Physics\nMinor in Astronomy\nIntroductory Courses - Physics\nIntermediate Courses - Physics\nAdvanced Courses - Physics\nPage 440 of 1019\nMedical and Health Physics Courses\nPhysics Education Courses\nIntroductory Courses - Astronomy\nIntermediate Courses - Astronomy \nAdvanced Courses - Astronomy\n \n \nCHAIR Julia Velkovska\nVICE CHAIR Kalman Varga\nDIRECTOR OF UNDERGRADUATE STUDIES Robert Scherrer\nDIRECTOR OF GRADUATE STUDIES (Physics) Alfredo Gurrola\nDIRECTOR OF GRADUATE STUDIES (Astrophysics) Jonathan Bird\nProfessors, Emeriti: John Barach, Charles Brau, David Ernst, Leonard Feldman, Joseph Hamilton, Arnold Heiser,\nCharles Maguire, Volker Oberacker, Akunuri Ramayya, Paul Sheldon, Norman Tolk, David Weintraub, Robert A.\nWeller\nProfessors: David Cliffel, John Gore, Senta Greene, Richard Haglund, J.

In keeping with this crucial role, the Department of Physics and Astronomy offers courses\ndealing with both the cultural and intellectual aspects of the disciplines, a broadly based major program flexible\nenough to serve as preparation for graduate study in physics, applied physics, medical physics, astronomy or\nastrophysics, professional study in another area, or technical employment, and minor programs for students\ndesiring to combine physics or astronomy with other majors. An honors program is available for qualified\ndepartmental majors.\n \nA distinguishing feature of the Vanderbilt undergraduate curriculum is the close coupling between teaching and\nresearch. At Vanderbilt, active research groups are studying the physics of elementary particles; nuclear structure\nand heavy-ion reactions; nonlinear interactions of lasers with materials at ultrafast time scales; the behavior of\nelectrons, atoms, molecules, and photons near surfaces; the electric and magnetic properties of living systems; the\nstructure and dynamics of biopolymers; young stars; and cosmology. All professors are engaged in research, and\nundergraduate students can participate in this research informally or through independent study or summer work.\nPage 441 of 1019\nThe Society of Physics Students arranges informal discussions.\nProgram of Concentration in Physics\nThe departmental major provides a thorough grounding in the core areas of physics. It is suitable either as\npreparation for careers in science and engineering or as a springboard for applying technical knowledge in such\nfields as business, medicine, law, public policy, and education. The major in the Department of Physics and\nAstronomy consists of 31\u201332 credit hours of course work, distributed as below. Students considering majoring in\nphysics are strongly encouraged to consult with the director of undergraduate studies before registering for classes.\n1. Core courses covering the major subdisciplines of physics \u2014 Students must complete four of the following (12\ncredit hours): Modern Physics and the Quantum World (2255); Classical Mechanics (2275); Electricity,\nMagnetism, and Electrodynamics I (2290); Statistical Physics (3200); Quantum Mechanics I (3651).\n2. Laboratory work \u2014 Students may not use AP credit to satisfy any portion of the laboratory sequence\nrequirement (3\u20134 credit hours):\na. Laboratory Principles I (1912L), Laboratory Principles II (2255L), and Introduction to Experimental\nResearch (2953L); or\nb. 1501L or 1601L, 1502L or 1602L, 2255L, and 2953L if the student has entered the major by taking the\nintroductory physics course sequence 1501 or 1601, 1501L or 1601L, 1502 or 1602, and 1502L or\n1602L. Students considering majoring in physics who begin in 1501 or 1601 and 1501L or 1601L in the\nfall semester are encouraged to take the combination 1502 + 1912L or 1602 + 1912L in the spring\nsemester.\n3. Electives (9 credit hours) \u2014 Pedagogical course work in physics and/or astronomy; research hours (3850,\n3851, 4998) do not count toward this requirement. The course electives may be taken from any 2000-level or\nhigher PHYS or ASTR courses not used to satisfy any other requirement of the major. Other courses may\ncount as electives, such as courses offered by the engineering school (or other departments and schools) that\nare particularly relevant, such as a course in environmental studies, health physics, optics, or materials\nscience. Such exceptions must be approved by the director of undergraduate studies.\n4. Capstone (7 credit hours) \u2014 Computational Physics (3790), 3 credit hours of research (3850, 3851, or 4998)\ntaken across one or more semesters, and the Seminar in Presenting Physics Research (3600). Physics-related\nresearch done in other departments and programs, supervised by Vanderbilt faculty and pre-approved by the\ndirector of undergraduate studies, is also permitted in satisfaction of the research requirement.\nImmersion Experience: A student majoring in physics may choose to complete their Immersion Experience through\nan enhanced research program within the disciplines of either physics or astronomy. To complete the Immersion\nExperience in physics or in astronomy, physics majors must complete at least 5 credit hours of research and earn 1\ncredit hour from PHYS 3600 (Seminar in Presenting Physics Research) and 3 credit hours from PHYS 3790\n(Computational Physics). At least 2 of these credit hours in research must be earned in either 3851 (Undergraduate\nImmersion Research) or 4998 (Honors Research). The other three (3) credit hours may be from any combination of\n3850, 3851, and 4998. Credit hours in research may be from PHYS, from ASTR, or from a combination of PHYS and\nASTR courses.\n \nComputer Science course work: All 2000-level and higher PHYS courses assume students have working skills in\nprogramming. These skills may be learned outside of a regular course, but should be equivalent to that taught in CS\n1104 Programming and Problem Solving. Students who do not already have these skills are strongly advised to take\nthis class in the first semester, prior to beginning the three-semester laboratory sequence in the second semester.\nIn addition, the following Computer Science and/or Scientific Computing courses are strongly recommended for all\nphysics majors: Program Design and Data Structures (CS 2201) or Program Design and Data Structures for Scientific\nComputing (CS 2204); Algorithms (CS 3250) or Scientific Computing Toolbox (SC 3250); and High Performance\nComputing (SC 3260). Physics majors pursuing a second major or minor in computer science should take CS 2201;\nphysics majors pursuing a minor in scientific computing should take CS 2204.\n \nMathematics course work: All physics majors are expected to have high-level skills in mathematics in order to be\nsuccessful in PHYS classes and to prepare for graduate work. MATH courses are not formally required for the major\nin physics; however, most physics courses identify MATH prerequisite or co-requisite courses in order to indicate the\nmathematical skill-level assumed for that class. Multivariable calculus is a co-requisite for 2255 and a prerequisite for\nall other 2000-level or higher PHYS courses. Physics majors are expected to develop a working knowledge of single-\nvariable calculus, multivariable calculus, and ordinary differential equations. The following courses are those\nstrongly recommended for physics majors:\nPage 442 of 1019\n1. Accelerated Calculus I (1300) and Accelerated Calculus II (1301);\n2. Multivariable Calculus (2300) or Multivariable Calculus and Linear Algebra (2500 and 2501); and\n3. Methods of Ordinary Differential Equations (2420) or Ordinary Differential Equations (2610).\nIn addition, for physics majors considering post-graduate work in physics or in a related field, the following PHYS and\nMATH courses are strongly recommended as electives:\n1. Electricity, Magnetism, and Electrodynamics II (PHYS 2291), Quantum Mechanics II (PHYS 3652),\nMathematical Methods of Physics (PHYS 4005); and\n2. Methods of Linear Algebra (MATH 2410) or Linear Algebra (MATH 2600); Introduction to Probability and\nMathematical Statistics (MATH 2820); Statistics Laboratory (MATH 2820L); Complex Variables (MATH 3110);\nIntroduction to Partial Differential Equations (MATH 3120); Fourier Analysis (MATH 3130); and Advanced\nEngineering Mathematics (MATH 3600).\nLicensure for Teaching\nCandidates for teacher licensure in physics at the secondary level may qualify by taking the basic physics major\ntogether with the requisite education courses described in the chapter on Licensure for Teaching in the Peabody\nCollege section of this catalog.\nHonors Program\nThe Honors Program in the Department of Physics and Astronomy is designed to allow a student to engage in \nadvanced research under the guidance of a faculty member, usually in an area related to an ongoing research\nprogram  in the department. A student majoring in physics interested in Honors (Honors in Physics or Honors in\nAstronomy) will work with a faculty mentor to develop an appropriate research project that will be conducted under\nthe guidance of that faculty member. The Honors project must have a substantial grounding in physics or\nastronomy, but may be conducted under the direct supervision of any faculty member in any department at\nVanderbilt. To be admitted to the Honors Program, a student must submit a two-page research proposal describing\nthe plans for their Honors project, which must be approved by the director of the departmental Honors Program. In\naddition, a student must have completed 2953L, either 2255 or 3651, and meet the minimum GPA requirements for\nhonors programs of the College of Arts and Science.\n \nTo graduate with honors, a student must\nHave at least a 300 cumulative GPA and a 3.300 GPA in courses that count toward the major.\nEarn a minimum of 6 credit hours in research classes (3850, 3851, 4998), leading to an honors thesis, with at\nleast 2 of these credit hours earned in A student who earns credit for 3852 may satisfy this portion of the\nrequirement with 3 credit hours of research earned at Vanderbilt, including at least 2 of these credit hours in\n4998.\nWrite a senior thesis of high merit, as evaluated by the student\u2019s Honors Examination Committee; the thesis\nmay be submitted either in the fall or spring semester of the senior year.\nDemonstrate high attainment on an oral honors examination in which they present and defend their work to\nthe student\u2019s Honors Examination Committee; the oral examination may take place either in the fall or spring\nsemester of the senior year.\nDepartmental Minors\nThe physics and astronomy minors are suitable for students who wish to supplement a related discipline or simply\nhave a general interest in the field. Research is not a requirement for either minor.\nMinor in Physics\nThe minor requires a minimum of 19 credit hours of course work, distributed as follows:\n \nPage 443 of 1019\nAny first-semester physics class\n(1501, 1601, 1911, 2051)\n3-4\nAny first-semester physics laboratory\n(1501L, 1601L, 1912L, 2052)\n1\nAny second-semester physics class\n(1502, 1602, 1912, 2053)\n3-4\nAny second-semester physics laboratory\n(1502L, 1602L, 2255L, 2054)\n1\nPHYS 2255 or 3651\n3\n6 credit hours of electives.\nThese may be selected from any 2000-level or higher-\nlevel PHYS courses not used to satisfy the above\nrequirements or from 3 credit hour non-PHYS courses, the\nlatter if approved by the director of undergraduate\nstudies, and may include up to 3 credit hours of research\n(3850, 3851, 4998).\n6\n \n \nTotal credit hours:   17-19 \n \nMinor in Astronomy\nThe minor requires a minimum of 16 credit hours of course work, distributed as follows:\n \nASTR 1010 and either 1010L or 1020L; or 1210\n4\nASTR 2110\n3\nASTR 3000\n3\nTwo other astronomy courses, one of which may be a 3\ncredit hour one-semester research project (3850, 3851,\n4998).

At Vanderbilt, the undergraduate\nprogram introduces students to the major areas of contemporary psychology: clinical science, human cognition and\ncognitive neuroscience, developmental psychology, neuroscience, and social psychology. Clinical science studies\nhuman personality, emotion, abnormal behavior, and therapeutic treatments. Human cognition and cognitive\nneuroscience are the study of processes such as learning, remembering, perceiving objects and events, and neural\nmechanisms underlying these processes. Developmental psychology examines human development from\nconception through adulthood, including cognitive, emotional, physical, and social aspects. Neuroscience studies the\nstructure and function of the brain and how nerve cells process sensory information, mediate decisions, and control\nmotor actions. Social psychology examines interpersonal and intergroup relations and the influence of social\nconditions on cognitive, emotional, and behavioral processes.\n \nThe Department of Psychology offers a general program of study for students who desire a broad background in\ncontemporary psychology, as well as an honors program. The department offers a wide variety of opportunities for\nundergraduates to gain research experience through active participation in faculty research projects. Such research\nexperience is considered a fundamental aspect of education in psychological science.\n \nPrograms of Concentration in Psychology\nGeneral Program\nPSY 1200\nPSY 2100 or PSY-PC 2110 (Peabody)\nPSY 2150\n4 Distribution Courses*\n5 Psychology Electives**\nTotal credit hours: 36\nPage 451 of 1019\nHonors Program\nPSY 1200\nPSY 2100 or PSY-PC 2110 (Peabody)\nPSY 2150\n4 Distribution Courses*\n2 or all 3 of PSY 3980, 3981, and 4998\nPSY 4999\n3 Psychology Electives\nStudents who only take two semesters of PSY 3980, 3981, and 4998 will need to take an additional elective course\nto fulfill their 42 credit hours.\nTotal credit hours: 42\n \nHonors Program\nThe Honors Program offers qualified majors the opportunity to conduct research projects in collaboration with\nfaculty members. This research culminates in the writing and public presentation of a senior thesis.\n \nThe Honors Program offers unusual opportunities for interested and qualified students, including special seminars\nand individual research projects. The program should substantially aid those intending to do graduate work.\n \nThe program requires three or four semesters of honors research and participation in the Honors Seminars, which\nare PSY 3980, 3981, 4998, and 4999. (Students must have at least 9 credit hours total, with mandatory enrollment\nin PSY 4999). Students may enroll in the three-semester options of the Honors Program\u2014provided they can\ncomplete the research project by extra work during three regular semesters and/or a summer, and provided this\narrangement is acceptable to the faculty mentor and to the director of the Honors Program. Students who take the\nthree-semester option will need to take an additional PSY elective course to fulfill their 42 credit hours.\n \nStudents who are majoring in psychology should apply to the Honors Program at the end of their sophomore year.\n \nApplicants are required to have a cumulative grade point average of at least 3.3, both overall and in all courses that\ncount toward the psychology major. Students must also find a faculty mentor who is willing to sponsor them in the\nprogram. Students who intend to apply the three-semester option should identify a faculty mentor and obtain\npermission for the option at the end of their sophomore year, but are not required to apply to the program until the\nend of the first term of their junior year. Students who complete the program successfully and have a final\ncumulative and major grade point average of 3.3 or higher will receive honors or highest honors in psychology.\n \n*Distribution Courses\n(at least 4 of the following 6 courses are required)\nThe following courses provide grounding in core content areas of psychological science.\n \nPSY 3100, 3110, 3120, 3750; NSC 2201; PSY-PC 1250 (Peabody)\nPage 452 of 1019\n** Electives\nAny course in the Department of Psychology (A&S) or the Department of Psychology and Human Development\n(Peabody) that is not being used to meet another psychology requirement can be used as an elective, unless\notherwise stated in the course catalog.\n \nComprehensive Exam\nIn order to graduate with a psychology major, students must take a comprehensive exam during their senior year.\nStudents are expected to take the comprehensive exam at the beginning of their last semester, typically spring\nsemester of their senior year. The exam is not graded, and no grade will appear on the student\u2019s transcript. The\npurpose of the exam is to assess the extent to which psychology majors are retaining core aspects of the\npsychology curriculum.\n \nMinor in Psychology\nThe minor in psychology is intended for those students who want to gain an overview of the science of psychology\nand its methodological foundations, and to sample more advanced work in the areas of specialization within\npsychology at Vanderbilt.\n \nStudents are required to complete 18 credit hours of course work inside the department, distributed as follows:\n \nPSY 1200\nPSY 2100 or PSY-PC 2110 (Peabody)\nPSY 2150\n2 courses from the list of Distribution Courses specified for the major\n1 Psychology Elective as defined in the psychology major\nTotal credit hours: 18\n \nIndependent/Directed Study courses (3850 and 3840/3860) may not be counted as the elective course for minors.\n \n1200 (or 1111, sections 1, 2, and 3) is prerequisite for all other psychology courses except 1111. PSY 1111 \u2013 01, 02,\n03 \u2013 General Psychology, First-Year Writing Seminar \u2013 covers the same material as PSY 1200 and also serves as the\nintroductory prerequisite for all 2000-level courses in psychology. Credit cannot be earned for both PSY 1200 and\nPSY 1111 \u2013 01, 02, or 03. PSY 1111\u2013 sections 4 and higher \u2013 are First-Year Writing Seminars on special topics in\npsychology. PSY1111 \u2013 sections 4 and higher \u2013 do not replace PSY 1200 as a prerequisite for all 2000-level courses\nin psychology and may be taken in conjunction with PSY 1200.\n \nNote: NSC courses 2201 (Neuroscience), 3235 (Biological Basis of Mental Disorders), 3269 (Developmental\nNeuroscience), 3270 (Computational Neuroscience), 3272 (Structure and Function of the Cerebral Cortex), and 3274\n(Neuroanatomy) count as courses in the Department of Psychology (A&S).

Students are also required to complete several prerequisites to\nprepare them for the major. Students may not double count any single course for both a required part of the core\nand for an elective.\n \nThe proposed core is interdisciplinary and includes rigorous course work drawn from political science, economics,\nsociology, anthropology, and history. The core provides all PPS students training in the politics, economics, methods,\nsocial contexts, history, and ethics of public policy.\n \nIn addition to developing skills in the core curriculum, PPS students seek more intensive training within areas of\nconcentration. The boundaries of these areas are not mutually exclusive, and together they span a wide range of\npolicy concerns and disciplinary perspectives. Among the five elective courses, students must take three courses in\na single area of concentration. It is also recommended that students choose electives from at least two disciplines.\n \nStudents pursuing the \u201ceconomic policy\u201d concentration must take at least two upper-level electives in economics\nfrom the list (numbered above 3000).\nPrerequisites\nPPS majors must have earned credit for MATH 1201 or 1301, or higher; basic statistics (ECON 1500 or 1510 or both\nMATH 2820L and either 2810 or 2820); and introductory courses in political science and economics (PSCI 1100,\nECON 1010, and ECON 1020).\nCore Curriculum (5 courses, 15 credit hours)\nPSCI 2256 or PPS 2100\n3 credit hours\nECON 3010, 3012, 3020, or 3022\n3 credit hours\nECON 3032, 3035, 3050; SOC 3002; or HOD 2500\n3 credit hours\nPPS 2200 and 2250\n6 credit hours\n \nIf a student cannot take both 2200 and 2250, they may, with prior approval from the director or associate director of\nPublic Policy Studies, substitute one course from ANTH 3122, 3133, 4152; HIST 2722; PSCI 3253; SOC 3315, 3604,\n3605, 3613, 3614.\nElectives and Areas of Concentration (5 courses, 15 credit hours)\nThe track is intended to allow students to go more deeply into one area of public policy (for example: health policy,\nSTEM policy, education policy, criminal justice policy). Each student is free to choose and design his or her own\nPage 454 of 1019\ntrack with the advice and approval of the program director. Classes should generally be upper-level and should\nrepresent at least two disciplines.\n \nGeneral Electives\nThe following courses may count as PPS general electives, but they do not count toward the three electives (9 credit\nhours) that must be taken within a single area of concentration: PSCI 2240, 2245, 2253, 3241, 3244.\n \nAreas of Concentration\nAdvanced Quantitative Methods for Public Policy\nPPS 3200 or 3250; ANTH 3261; ECON 4050; HOD 3200; PSCI 2300\n \nEconomic Policy\nECON 2150, 3150, 3200, 3230, 3250, 3700, 4110, 4210, 4510/4510W, 4530/4530W; HIST 1640, 1660; HODE 3225;\nPSCI 2223, 3252\n \nSocial Policy\nECON 3100, 3110, 3350; HIST 1440, 1665, 2690, 2740, 2810, 3040, 3045W; MHS 2110, 3020, 3220, 3030, 3320;\nSOC 3223, 3304, 3611, 3616, 3621, 3622, 3701, 3711; UNIV 3320, 3325\n \nEnvironmental, Resource, and Energy Policy\nANTH 2109, 2150, 3134; ECON 2170; SOC 3311, 3312, 3314, 3315, 3316, 3317, 3318\n \nInternational and Foreign Policy\nAMER 3200; ASIA 2560; ECON 2220, 3600, 3610, 3650, 4520; GSS (formerly WGS) 3201, 3281; HIST 1690, 1691,\n1730, 1740, 2457, 2535, 2700,  2710, 2721, 2722, 2735, 2740; JS 2540; MHS 2410, 2420, 3110; PSCI 2220, 2222,\n2225, 2236, 2251, 3229, 3272W, 3275\n \nScience, Technology, and Innovation Policy\nCMST 2850, 2950; CSET 3090, 3100; ECON 3270; HIST 2780, 3050, 3070W; MHS 3120; PHIL 1008, 3608; SOC 3206\nHonors Track (2 additional courses, 6 additional hours)\nStudents who have a GPA of 3.30 or higher for all previous courses taken for credit and a GPA of 3.50 for all courses\ncounting toward the PPS major may apply for the honors track in PPS. Students normally apply for the honors track\nduring the second semester of their junior year. By the end of the junior year, students interested in pursuing honors\nshould have completed all of the required core courses in the PPS major. The PPS program director may make\nexceptions.\n \nThose accepted into the honors track enroll in PPS 4980 and 4999 (3 credit hours each) during the fall or spring\nsemesters of their senior year. In addition to the honors seminar, each honors student has a faculty adviser to\nprovide guidance on the research project and to chair the thesis committee. Successful completion of the honors\nprogram entails both the production of an original written thesis and an oral exam on the thesis project. The thesis\ncommittee evaluates both the written thesis and oral exam.\nPage 455 of 1019\nQuantum Information Science and Engineering\nDIRECTORS Kalman Varga and Daniel Fleetwood\n \nAffiliated Faculty\nPROFESSORS Daniel M.

Religion has always been\nactive in human affairs for good and for ill, encompassing histories, literatures, politics, cosmologies, and medicines.\nUnderstanding the diversity of religious traditions on their own terms is vital for accuracy in approaching the world's\nmany challenges. The faculty of Vanderbilt's Religious Studies Department and our many affiliated faculty across\nthe university provide expertise and research in a variety of religious traditions. In addition to our expertise in\nspecific religious cultures, texts, practices, rituals, and histories, we also share research interests and teaching focus\non the religious dimensions of race and caste, colonialism, gender and sexuality, health and healing, and the climate\ncrisis.\n \nStudents majoring in religious studies gain a deep knowledge of a single tradition, region, or theme and a broad\nunderstanding of religions around the world. Successful students develop a highly portable analytical skill set that\nequips them to pursue graduate degrees in religion or cognate disciplines, as well as professional degrees and\ncareers in fields such as law, diplomacy, medicine, and business. It also provides an excellent second major for a\nvariety of disciplines that address the human condition including neuroscience; sociology; history; medicine, health,\nPage 457 of 1019\nand society; and others. Majors will gain the ability to reason intelligently about one of the most difficult and\nsensitive topics in any society. By virtue of the variety of religious cultures studied, the training will deepen\nstudents\u2019 mutual understanding and sensitivity to prepare them to become truly responsible global citizens.\n \nThe department offers a major (31 credit hours), an Honors Program, a minor (18 credit hours) in religious studies, a\nminor (20 credit hours) in Islamic studies, and a minor in Arabic language (18 credit hours). A student may pursue\nboth the minor in Islamic studies and the minor in Arabic language.\n \nProgram of Concentration in Religious Studies\n31 credit hours. The program of concentration in religious studies seeks to introduce students to the rich diversity of\nreligious traditions in the world (Breadth component) and to build depth of study in areas of specific interest to the\nstudent (Depth component). In addition, the curriculum includes instruction in the range of theories and methods\nused to approach religious traditions academically (Tools of the Discipline component). The student will then be able\nto pursue individual interests (electives).\n \nA maximum of two courses (6 credit hours) outside of the department may count toward the major. Of these, one\ncourse (3 credit hours) outside of the department may count toward the Depth Component. A foreign language\ncourse approved as an elective is not subject to the two-course (6 credit hours) limit. No course may be used to\nsatisfy more than one of the four components of the major.\n \n1.

Students who complete this minor will have a toolkit that includes\nprogramming skills useful for simulating physical, biological, and social dynamics as well as an understanding of\nhow to take advantage of modern software tools to extract meaningful information from small and large data sets.\n \nComputation is now an integral part of modern science. Computer simulation allows the study of natural phenomena\nimpossible or intractable through experimental means. Astronomers studying the formation of massive black holes,\nneuroscientists studying brain networks for human memory, economists studying effects of regulation on market\ndynamics, and biochemists studying the three-dimensional structure of proteins are united in many of the\ncomputational challenges they face and the tools and techniques they use to solve these challenges.\n \nStudents pursuing the scientific computing minor are taught techniques for understanding such complex physical,\nbiological, and social systems. Students are introduced to computational methods for simulating and analyzing\nmodels of complex systems, to scientific visualization and data mining techniques needed to detect structure in\nmassively large multidimensional data sets, to high-performance computing techniques for simulating models on\ncomputing clusters with hundreds or thousands of parallel, independent processors and for analyzing terabytes or\nmore of data that may be distributed across a massive cloud or grid storage environment.\n \nThe scientific computing minor at Vanderbilt is supported by faculty and includes students from a wide range of\nscientific and engineering disciplines. While the content domain varies, these disciplines often require\nsimilar computational approaches, high-performance computing resources, and skills to simulate interactions, model\nreal-life systems, and test competing hypotheses. Scientific computing embodies the computational tools and\ntechniques for solving many of the grand challenges facing science and engineering today.\n \nThe minor in scientific computing prepares students for advanced course work that combines computational  \napproaches with a substantive area of science or engineering. It prepares students for directed or independent\nstudy with a faculty member on a research project. It prepares students for advanced study in graduate school. It\nprovides skills that will be attractive to many employers after graduation.\n \nThe minor in scientific computing is distinct from the minor in computer science. Scientific computing uses\ncomputation as a tool to solve scientific and engineering problems in research and application. It is more focused on\nsimulation, numerical techniques, high performance computing, and higher-level methods than the minor in\ncomputer science, which is focused on the algorithms, systems, and technologies that enable such methods to be\ndeveloped and employed.\n \nDetails of the minor requirements are provided in the School of Engineering section of the catalog, and are also\navailable at vanderbilt.edu/scientific_computing.\nSociology\nProgram of Concentration in Sociology\nPage 463 of 1019\nComprehensive Exam\nProgram of Concentration in Environmental Sociology\nComprehensive Exam\nMinor in Sociology\nLicensure for Teaching\n \n \nCHAIR Holly McCammon\nDIRECTOR OF UNDERGRADUATE STUDIES Laurie Woods\nDIRECTOR OF GRADUATE STUDIES Jennifer Davis\nProfessors, Emeriti: George Becker, Karen Campbell, Walter Gove, Gary Jensen, Ronnie Steinberg\nProfessors: Andre Christie-Mizell, Daniel Cornfield, Jennifer Davis, David Hess, Larry Isaac, Holly McCammon,\nJonathan Metzl, Velma Murry\nAssociate Professors: Laura Carpenter, Shaul Kelner, Richard Lloyd, Joshua Murray, Mariano Sana, Lijun Song\nAssistant Professors: Brianna Castro, Lucie Kalousova, Bianca Manago, Lawrence Stacey, Rachel Donnelly,\nAlexandre Frenette\nAssociate Professor of the Practice: Zdravka Tzankova\nSenior Lecturer: Laurie Woods\n \nCOURSES OFFERED: SOC\n \nSociology, the study of social consensus, conflict, and change, offers students a rich and systematic understanding\nof society and the meaning of social interaction.

If students take more than 6 credit hours of SOC 4981,\nthe additional credit hours (7\u201312) are counted toward the elective courses.\nSuccessful completion of at least two semesters of SOC 4981 (Honors Research). The first semester of 4981\n(Honors Research) is a 3 credit hour seminar in which students develop the literature review and research\nplan for the honors thesis. In the second semester of 4981 (Honors Research), also for 3 credit hours, students\nmust complete the research and data collection, data analysis, and initial write-up of results of the thesis.\nStudents may elect to take a third or fourth semester of 4981 during their senior year, when they may, for\nexample, work on revisions of the project and/or on publication. Students who begin the Honors Track in their\nsenior year may also take more than 6 credit hours of 4981, up to a maximum of 12 credit hours.\nSuccessful defense of the completed thesis through an oral defense attended by the chair and reader of the\nthesis; this oral defense typically takes place during the second semester of the student\u2019s senior year. In\norder to earn honors in sociology, students must successfully complete and defend an honors thesis before\ngraduation.\nComprehensive Exam\nIn order to graduate with a sociology major, students must take a comprehensive exam during their senior year. The\nexam is not graded, and no grade will appear on the student\u2019s transcript. The purpose of the exam is to test the\nextent to which sociology majors are retaining core aspects of the sociology curriculum.\n \nProgram of Concentration in Environmental Sociology\nEnvironmental sociology is the study of the relationship between modern societies and the environment at a variety\nof scales, from households to global relations. It includes issues such as public understanding of environmental\nissues, the environment and inequality, environmental social movements and social change, and analysis of\nenvironmental reform and adaptation. Environmental sociology is different from environmental science, which is\nbased in the natural sciences, and environmental studies, which includes courses from a wide range of disciplines,\nincluding engineering and the humanities. The department\u2019s program in environmental sociology includes a solid\nintroduction to sociology and sociological methods as well as foundation requirements in environmental science.\nThe program prepares students for careers in government, the law, management, research and teaching, and the\nnonprofit sector.\n \nStudents majoring in environmental sociology are required to complete 33 credit hours of course work. The major\nconsists of four types of courses: foundation social science courses, foundation environmental science courses,\nresearch skills, and environmental sociology courses.\n \nProgram I (Standard Track)\nPage 466 of 1019\nA total of at least 33 credit hours as follows:\n \n1.

Students interested in pursuing the Honors Research Track in\nEnvironmental Sociology should contact the director of undergraduate studies of Sociology for more information. To\nbe considered for the Honors Research Track in Environmental Sociology, a student must have a minimum\ncumulative GPA of 3.3 and a minimum GPA of 3.3 for courses that count toward the environmental sociology major.\nStudents who are recommended for the program by the director of undergraduate studies of Sociology will typically\nbegin the program in the first semester of their junior or senior year.\n \nThe Honors Research Track in Environmental Sociology requires:\n1. Successful completion of requirements 1 through 3 in the Standard Track.\n2. At least 12 credit hours from requirement 4 in the Standard Track.\n3. Successful completion of at least two semesters of SOC 4981 (Honors Research). The first semester of 4981\n(Honors Research) is a 3 credit hour seminar in which students develop the literature review and research\nplan for the honors thesis. In the second semester of 4981 (Honors Research), also for 3 credit hours, students\nmust complete the research and data collection, data analysis, and initial write-up of results of the thesis.\nStudents may elect to take a third or fourth semester of 4981 during their senior year, when they may, for\nexample, work on revisions of the project and/or on publication.

The study of theatre introduces students to a major form of literature and performing arts, thereby\ndeveloping a familiarity with one of the greatest cultural heritages and an understanding of human behavior and\ncivilization as it is reflected through the ages. Theatre uniquely shapes perceptions about life into an active\nexperience. Because this process encourages critical thought and discussion, the department provides a singular\nand important aspect of a liberal arts education through its production season and course work. Viewed as a\npractical extension of the department\u2019s curriculum, plays are produced in Neely Auditorium, a laboratory where\nstudents learn to form creative expressions as well as to evaluate and to critique them.\n \nOn one level, the Department of Theatre helps the general liberal arts student develop reasoned standards of\ncriticism and an understanding of the intimate correlation between the theatre and the society which it reflects,\npreparing Vanderbilt graduates for successful careers in theatre as well as other fields of interest. For its majors and\nminors, the department provides a more detailed and specialized study of the major components of theatrical\nendeavor, allowing opportunities for the practical application of course work in the productions staged at the\ntheatre. In many cases, the department helps to prepare students with professional aspirations as either artists or\nteachers in their specialized area of interest.\n \nWork in the productions at Vanderbilt reflects the instruction that occurs in the classroom at Neely Auditorium.\nBecause the academic endeavors require hands-on, project-oriented teaching, students can expect small-to-\nmedium class enrollments and numerous opportunities for exposure to faculty instruction outside of the classroom.\nThe department\u2019s curriculum includes courses in acting, directing, design, technology, dramatic literature, theatre\nhistory and criticism, and playwriting. The Department of Theatre frequently offers a Maymester program of study of\ntheatre in London and the U.K. Students can either major or minor in theatre at Vanderbilt. The major consists of a\nminimum of 35 credit hours that include courses in acting, directing, dramatic literature, theatre history/criticism,\ndesign, technology, and stagecraft. For the minor, students select one of three more narrowly focused tracks\n(dramatic literature/theatre history, acting/directing, or design/technology) and complete a minimum of 18 credit\nhours of course work.\n \nStudents may also learn about theatre by studying with Coe Artists, distinguished guest-artist professionals brought\nto campus each year to benefit majors, minors, and those with a serious interest in theatre. Weeklong master\nclasses are taught by playwrights, actors, designers, and directors from the professional world of theatre, television,\nand film. Previous Coe Artists have included such celebrated artists as Tim Miller, Sojourn Theatre, Katie Pearl, Lisa\nD\u2019Amour, and Shawn Hall. Theatre also brings professional directors and designers as Coe Artists to campus to work\nwithin the department's production season.\nPage 476 of 1019\nStudents have the opportunity to participate in a variety of theatrical experiences working with professional guests,\nas well as hear professional artists speak as guest lecturers.\n \nTheatre majors and minors from Vanderbilt have entered a wide variety of professions and post-graduate\nopportunities after they graduate. Those seeking employment in the fields of theatre, film, radio, or television have\nsecured positions at appropriate graduate schools or internships with professional companies immediately following\ntheir study at Vanderbilt. Many distinguished professional theatre companies across the nation, television networks\nin New York, and the film industry in Los Angeles include Vanderbilt University Theatre alumni as writers, actors,\ndesigners, technicians, dramaturgs, and stage managers. In addition, many Vanderbilt theatre students have\nsecured teaching assignments at either the college/university level (once they have completed appropriate post-\ngraduate education) or the elementary/secondary education level. Theatre also prepares students for success in\nother professions including medicine, law, education, policy, engineering, and business to name a few.\n \nThe study and practice of theatre offers individuals opportunities to participate through a variety of means: to\ncollaborate with all other members of a production team; to express elements of abstract thought in both oral and\nwritten form; and to develop the critical ability to assess and analyze aesthetic choices.\n \n \nProgram of Concentration in Theatre\nStudents majoring in theatre are required to complete a minimum of 35 credit hours in courses concerned\nexclusively with theatre and dramatic literature. Required courses are 1010/1010W or 1111, 1711, 1611 2651, and\n4961; two courses chosen from 2201, 2202W, 2204, and 4201; one course chosen from 3721, 3761, and 3741;\nadditional 9 credit hours chosen from other theatre courses above the 2000 level.\n \nHonors Program\nThe Honors Program in Theatre is designed to afford superior students the opportunity to pursue more intensive\nwork within their major field.

Vanderbilt delivers much of this\ninformation via email. Official electronic notifications, including those required by statutes, those required by\nuniversity policy, and instructions from university officials, will be sent to students\u2019 Vanderbilt email addresses:\nuser.name@vanderbilt.edu. Students are required to be familiar with the contents of official university\nnotifications, and to respond to instructions and other official correspondence requiring a response. Some\nmessages will include links to the YES Message Center, which is a secure channel for official communication of a\nconfidential nature. However, students should not wait to receive such a message, and should check YES\nfrequently to remain current on official, confidential communications.\nThe university makes every effort to avoid inundating students with nonessential email (often called \u201cspam\u201d),\nand maintains separate lists from which students may unsubscribe for announcements of general interest.\nDirectory information should be kept current. Students may report address changes, emergency contact\ninformation, and missing person contact information via the web by logging in to YES (Your Enrollment Services)\nhttps://yes.vanderbilt.edu and clicking on the Personal Information link.\nStudent Records (Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act)\nPage 478 of 1019\nVanderbilt University is subject to the provisions of federal law known as the Family Educational Rights and\nPrivacy Act (also referred to as FERPA). This act affords matriculated students certain rights with respect to their\neducational records. These rights include:\n1. The right to inspect and review their education records within 45 days of the day the University receives a\nrequest for access. Students should submit to the Office of the University Registrar written requests that\nidentify the record(s) they wish to inspect. The Office of the University Registrar will make arrangements\nfor access and notify the student of the time and place where the records may be inspected. If the Office\nof the University Registrar does not maintain the records, the student will be directed to the University\nofficial to whom the request should be addressed.\n2. The right to request the amendment of any part of their education records that a student believes is\ninaccurate or misleading. Students who wish to request an amendment to their educational record should\nwrite the University official responsible for the record, clearly identify the part of the record they want\nchanged, and specify why it is inaccurate or misleading. If the University decides not to amend the record\nas requested by the student, the student will be notified of the decision and advised of his or her right to a\nhearing.\n3. The right to consent to disclosures of personally identifiable information contained in the student\u2019s\neducation records to third parties, except in situations that FERPA allows disclosure without the student\u2019s\nconsent. These exceptions include:\nDisclosure to school officials with legitimate educational interests. A \u201cschool official\u201d is a person\nemployed by the University in an administrative, supervisory, academic or research, or support-\nstaff position (including University law enforcement personnel and health staff); contractors,\nconsultants, and other outside service providers with whom the University has contracted; a\nmember of the Board of Trust; or a student serving on an official University committee, such as the\nHonor Council, Student Conduct Council, or a grievance committee, or assisting another school\nofficial in performing his or her tasks. A school official has a legitimate educational interest if the\nofficial needs to review an education record in order to fulfill his or her professional responsibility.\nDisclosure to parents if the student is a dependent for tax purposes\nDisclosure to appropriate individuals (e.g., parents/guardians, spouses, housing staff, health care\npersonnel, police, etc.) where disclosure is in connection with a health or safety emergency and\nknowledge of such information is necessary to protect the health or safety of the student or other\nindividuals.\nDisclosure to a parent or legal guardian of a student, information regarding the student\u2019s violation\nof any federal, state, or local law, or of any rule or policy of the institution, governing the use or\npossession of alcohol or a controlled substance if the University has determined that the student\nhas committed a disciplinary violation with respect to the use or possession and the student is\nunder the age of 21 at the time of the disclosure to the parent/guardian.\nDisclosure to various authorized representatives of government entities (such as, compliance with\nStudent and Exchange Visitors Information System [SEVIS], Solomon Amendment, etc.).\nFERPA provides the university the ability to designate certain student information as \u201cdirectory information.\u201d\nDirectory information may be made available to any person without the student\u2019s consent unless the student\ngives notice as provided for, below. Vanderbilt has designated the following as directory information: the\nstudent\u2019s name, address, telephone number, email address, student ID photos, major field of study, school,\nclassification, participation in officially recognized activities and sports, weights and heights of members of\nathletic teams, dates of attendance, degrees and awards received, the most recent previous educational agency\nor institution attended by the student, and other information that would not generally be considered harmful or\nan invasion of privacy if disclosed. Any student who does not wish disclosure of directory information should\nnotify the Office of the University Registrar in writing. No element of directory information as defined above is\nreleased for students who request nondisclosure except as required by statute.\nThe request for nondisclosure does not apply to class rosters in online class management applications, or to\nresidential rosters\u2014or rosters of groups a student may join voluntarily\u2014in online, co-curricular engagement\napplications, or rosters of other information on the websites of student organizations that a student may join.\nNeither class rosters in online class management applications, nor residential rosters in online co-curricular\nengagement applications, are available to the public.\nAs of January 3, 2012, the U.S. Department of Education\u2019s FERPA regulations expand the circumstances under\nwhich students\u2019 education records and personally identifiable information (PII) contained in such records\u2014\nincluding Social Security Numbers, grades, or other private information\u2014may be accessed without consent. First,\nthe U.S. Comptroller General, the U.S. Attorney General, the U.S. Secretary of Education, or state and local\nPage 479 of 1019\neducation authorities (\u201cFederal and State Authorities\u201d) may allow access to student records and PII without\nconsent to any third party designated by a Federal or State Authority to evaluate a federal- or state-supported\neducation program. The evaluation may relate to any program that is \u201cprincipally engaged in the provision of\neducation,\u201d such as early childhood education and job training, as well as any program that is administered by an\neducation agency or institution.\nSecond, Federal and State Authorities may allow access to education records and PII without consent, to\nresearchers performing certain types of studies, in certain cases even when the University objects to or does not\nrequest such research. Federal and State Authorities must obtain certain use-restriction and data security\npromises from the third parties that they authorize to receive PII, but the Authorities need not maintain direct\ncontrol over the third parties.\nIn addition, in connection with Statewide Longitudinal Data Systems, State Authorities may collect, compile,\npermanently retain, and share without student consent, PII from education records, and may track student\nparticipation in education and other programs by linking such PII to other personal information that they obtain\nfrom other Federal or State data sources, including workforce development, unemployment insurance, child\nwelfare, juvenile justice, military service, and migrant student records systems.\nIf a student believes the university has failed to comply with FERPA, he or she may file a complaint using the\nStudent Complaint and Grievance Procedures as outlined in the Student Handbook. If dissatisfied with the\noutcome of this procedure, students may file a written complaint with the Family Policy Compliance Office, U.S.\nDepartment of Education, 400 Maryland Avenue SW, Washington, DC 20202-5920.\nQuestions about the application of the provisions of the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act should be\ndirected to the Office of the University Registrar or to the Office of General Counsel.\nThe Vanderbilt Honor Code and the Honor System\nVanderbilt University takes pride in its honor code and its student-run honor system.\nThe statement of the honor code is shared by all ten schools of the university:\nVanderbilt University students pursue all academic endeavors with integrity. They conduct themselves\nhonorably, professionally, and respectfully in all realms of their studies in order to promote and secure an\natmosphere of dignity and trust. The keystone of our honor system is self-regulation, which requires cooperation\nand support from each member of the University community.\nThe Honor System is a time-honored tradition that began with the first classes at Vanderbilt in 1875. Students\nestablished the system and continue to manage it today. It rests on the presumption that all work submitted as\npart of course requirements is produced by the student, without help from any other source unless\nacknowledgement is given in a manner prescribed by the instructor. Cheating, plagiarizing, or otherwise\nfalsifying results of study are specifically prohibited. The system applies not only to examinations but also to\nwritten work and computer programs submitted to instructors. Detailed descriptions of Honor System violations\nand Undergraduate Honor Council procedures are published in the Student Handbook, available on the web at\nvanderbilt.edu/student_handbook.\nResponsibility for the preservation of the system falls on the individual student who, by registration,\nacknowledges the authority of the Undergraduate Honor Council. Students are expected to demand of\nthemselves and their fellow students complete respect for the Honor Code. Ignorance of the regulations is not a\ndefense for abuse of regulations. All incoming students attend a mandatory signing ceremony and educational\nprogram on the Honor System at the beginning of the fall semester. Additional information about the Honor\nPage 480 of 1019\nSystem is available on the web at studentorg.vanderbilt.edu/honorcouncil/.\nVA Compliance Statement\nAny covered individual will be able to attend or participate in the course of education during the period beginning\non the date on which the individual provides to the educational institution a certificate of eligibility for\nentitlement to educational assistance under chapter 31 or 33 (a \u201ccertificate of eligibility\u201d can also include a\n\u201cStatement of Benefits\u201d obtained from the Department of Veterans Affairs\u2019 (VA) website \u2013 eBenefits, or a VAF 28-\n1905 form for chapter 31 authorization purposes) and ending on the earlier of the following dates:\n1. The date on which payment from VA is made to the institution.\n2. 90 days after the date the institution certified tuition and fees following the receipt of the certificate of\neligibility.\nVanderbilt University will not impose any penalty, including the assessment of late fees, the denial of access to\nclasses, libraries, or other institutional facilities, or the requirement that a covered individual borrow additional\nfunds, on any covered individual because of the individual\u2019s inability to meet his or her financial obligations to\nthe institution due to the delayed disbursement funding from VA under chapter 31 or 33.\nVanderbilt University\nAccreditation\nVanderbilt University is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges\n(SACSCOC) to award baccalaureate, masters, and doctorate degrees.
